Because this has been one of the primary discussion points in off-chain Cosmos governance discussions, we believe it is important to get a signal on the matter from the on-chain governance process of the Cosmos Hub. \n\n There have been past discussions on the Cosmos Forum about placing an in-protocol restriction on validators from charging 0% commission.  https://forum.cosmos.network/t/governance-limit-validators-from-0-commission-fee/2182 \n\n This proposal is NOT proposing a protocol-enforced minimum.  It is merely a signalling proposal to query the viewpoint of the bonded Atom holders as a whole. \n\n We encourage people to discuss the question behind this governance proposal in the associated Cosmos Hub forum post here:  https://forum.cosmos.network/t/proposal-are-validators-charging-0-commission-harmful-to-the-success-of-the-cosmos-hub/2505 \n\n Also, for voters who believe that 0% commission rates are harmful to the network, we encourage optionally sharing your belief on what a healthy minimum commission rate for the network using the memo field of their vote transaction on this governance proposal or linking to a longer written explanation such as a Forum or blog post. \n\n The question on this proposal is “Are validators charging 0% commission harmful to the success of the Cosmos Hub?”.  A Yes vote is stating that they ARE harmful to the network's success, and a No vote is a statement that they are NOT harmful.","proposer":""},{"id":"13","messages":[{"@type":"/cosmos.gov.v1.MsgExecLegacyContent","content":{"@type":"/cosmos.gov.v1beta1.TextProposal","title":"Cosmos Hub 3 Upgrade Proposal A","description":"This is a proposal to approve these high-level changes for a final vote for what will become Cosmos Hub 3.

We will develop and document governance features and practices, and then communicate these to the broader Cosmos community.\n\n_Future_\nAt the end of Q1, we’ll publish recommendations for the future of the Cosmos GWG, and ideally we’ll be prepared to submit a proposal based upon those recommendations for Q2 2020. We plan to continue our work in blockchain governance, regardless of whether the Hub passes our proposals.\n\n-=-=-\n\nCosmos forum: https://forum.cosmos.network/c/governance\nCosmos GWG Telegram channel: https://t.me/hubgov\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/CosmosGov","proposer":""},{"id":"25","messages":[{"@type":"/cosmos.gov.v1.MsgExecLegacyContent","content":{"@type":"/cosmos.distribution.v1beta1.CommunityPoolSpendProposal","title":"CosmWasm Integration 1 - Permissions and Upgrades","description":"CosmWasm Integration 1 - Permissions and Upgrades\n\nCommunity-spend proposal submitted by Ethan Frey (https://github.com/ethanfrey) of Confio UO (http://confio.tech/) and CosmWasm (https://www.cosmwasm.com)\n\n-=-=-\n\nFull proposal: https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmbD3bMajQCFmtDmkuRVWhmMWVdN2sK8QP2FoFCz9cjPiC\nForum Post: https://forum.cosmos.network/t/proposal-cosmwasm-on-cosmos-hub/3629\n\n-=-=-\n\nAmount to spend from the community pool: 25000 ATOMs\n\nTimeline: 2-4 months from approval\n\nDeliverables:\n1.

For example, a single address could use 70% of its voting power to vote Yes and 30% of its voting power to vote No. Clients may opt into supporting this feature, as the existing UX of voting for a single option is preserved.\n\nThis is beneficial because oftentimes the entity owning that address might not be a single individual. For example, a company or organization that owns an address might have different stakeholders who want to vote differently, and so it makes sense to allow them to split their voting power.\n\nAnother example use case is exchanges and custodians.

For example, a single address could use 70% of its voting power to vote Yes and 30% of its voting power to vote No. Clients may opt into supporting this feature, as the existing UX of voting for a single option is preserved.\n\nThis is beneficial because oftentimes the entity owning that address might not be a single individual. For example, a company or organization that owns an address might have different stakeholders who want to vote differently, and so it makes sense to allow them to split their voting power.\n\nAnother example use case is exchanges and custodians.

ATOM is currently well positioned to play this role among Cosmos assets because it has the highest market cap, most liquidity, largest brand, and many integrations with fiat onramps. ATOM is the gateway to Cosmos.\n\nIn the Cosmos Hub Port City vision, ATOMs are pitched as equity in the Cosmos Hub.  However, this alone is insufficient to establish ATOM as the base currency of the Cosmos ecosystem as a whole. Instead, the ATOM community must work to actively promote the use of ATOMs throughout the Cosmos ecosystem, rather than passively relying on the Hub's reputation to create ATOM's value.\n\nIn order to cement the role of ATOMs in Cosmos DeFi, the Cosmos Hub should leverage its community pool to help align incentives with other protocols within the Cosmos ecosystem. We propose beginning this initiative by using the community pool ATOMs to incentivize deep ATOM base pair liquidity pools on the Osmosis Network.\n\nOsmosis is the first IBC-enabled DeFi application. Within its 3 weeks of existence, it has already 100x’d the number of IBC transactions ever created, demonstrating the power of IBC and the ability of the Cosmos SDK to bootstrap DeFi protocols with $100M+ TVL in a short period of time. Since its announcement Osmosis has helped bring renewed attention and interest to Cosmos from the crypto community at large and kickstarted the era of Cosmos DeFi.\n\nOsmosis has already helped in establishing ATOM as the Schelling Point of the Cosmos ecosystem.  The genesis distribution of OSMO was primarily based on an airdrop to ATOM holders specifically, acknowledging the importance of ATOM to all future projects within the Cosmos. Furthermore, the Osmosis LP rewards currently incentivize ATOMs to be one of the main base pairs of the platform.\n\nOsmosis has the ability to incentivize AMM liquidity, a feature not available on any other IBC-enabled DEX. Osmosis already uses its own native OSMO liquidity rewards to incentivize ATOMs to be one of the main base pairs, leading to ~2.2 million ATOMs already providing liquidity on the platform.\n\nIn addition to these native OSMO LP Rewards, the platform also includes a feature called “external incentives” that allows anyone to permissionlessly add additional incentives in any token to the LPs of any AMM pools they wish.

ATOM is currently well positioned to play this role among Cosmos assets because it has the highest market cap, most liquidity, largest brand, and many integrations with fiat onramps. ATOM is the gateway to Cosmos.\n\nIn the Cosmos Hub Port City vision, ATOMs are pitched as equity in the Cosmos Hub.  However, this alone is insufficient to establish ATOM as the base currency of the Cosmos ecosystem as a whole. Instead, the ATOM community must work to actively promote the use of ATOMs throughout the Cosmos ecosystem, rather than passively relying on the Hub's reputation to create ATOM's value.\n\nIn order to cement the role of ATOMs in Cosmos DeFi, the Cosmos Hub should leverage its community pool to help align incentives with other protocols within the Cosmos ecosystem. We propose beginning this initiative by using the community pool ATOMs to incentivize deep ATOM base pair liquidity pools on the Osmosis Network.\n\nOsmosis is the first IBC-enabled DeFi application. Within its 3 weeks of existence, it has already 100x’d the number of IBC transactions ever created, demonstrating the power of IBC and the ability of the Cosmos SDK to bootstrap DeFi protocols with $100M+ TVL in a short period of time. Since its announcement Osmosis has helped bring renewed attention and interest to Cosmos from the crypto community at large and kickstarted the era of Cosmos DeFi.\n\nOsmosis has already helped in establishing ATOM as the Schelling Point of the Cosmos ecosystem.  The genesis distribution of OSMO was primarily based on an airdrop to ATOM holders specifically, acknowledging the importance of ATOM to all future projects within the Cosmos. Furthermore, the Osmosis LP rewards currently incentivize ATOMs to be one of the main base pairs of the platform.\n\nOsmosis has the ability to incentivize AMM liquidity, a feature not available on any other IBC-enabled DEX. Osmosis already uses its own native OSMO liquidity rewards to incentivize ATOMs to be one of the main base pairs, leading to ~2.2 million ATOMs already providing liquidity on the platform.\n\nIn addition to these native OSMO LP Rewards, the platform also includes a feature called “external incentives” that allows anyone to permissionlessly add additional incentives in any token to the LPs of any AMM pools they wish.

The following updates are included in gaia v6.0.0:\n * Bump [Cosmos-SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk) to [v0.44.3](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/releases/tag/v0.44.3) which notably includes fixes for the vesting accounts and two new modules outlined below. For a full list of updates in Cosmos-SDK v0.44.3 please see the [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/release/v0.44.x/CHANGELOG.md#v0443---2021-10-21)\n     * Add the [authz](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/tree/v0.44.3/x/authz/spec) module to the Cosmos Hub. `x/authz` is an implementation of a Cosmos SDK module, per [ADR 30](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.44.3/docs/architecture/adr-030-authz-module.md), that allows granting arbitrary privileges from one account (the granter) to another account (the grantee). Authorizations must be granted for a particular Msg service method one by one using an implementation of the `Authorization` interface.\n     * Add the [feegrant](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/tree/v0.44.3/x/feegrant/spec) module to the Cosmos Hub. This module allows accounts to grant fee allowances and to use fees from their accounts. Grantees can execute any transaction without the need to maintain sufficient fees.\n     * **NOTICE** It's imortant to highlight [PR #10041](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/10041) which impacts **WALLETS AND EXCHANGES**. This update has removed the deprecated the legacy REST endpoints for broadcast \u0026 encode. **This means `POST /tx` and `POST /txs/encode` no longer work**. Please see the [REST Endpoints Migration guide](https://docs.cosmos.network/master/migrations/rest.html) to migrate to the new REST endpoints.\n * Add [IBC](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go) as a standalone module from the Cosmos SDK using version [v2.0.0](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/releases/tag/v2.0.0). See the [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/v2.0.0/CHANGELOG.md) for details.\n     * Please note that the governance parameter for `MaxExpectedBlockDelay` is set to 30 seconds. This means if a connection is opened with a packet delay of 1 minute, it requires 2 blocks to be committed after the consensus state is submitted before the packet can be processed.\n * Add [packet-forward-middleware](https://github.com/strangelove-ventures/packet-forward-middleware) [v1.0.1](https://github.com/strangelove-ventures/packet-forward-middleware/releases/tag/v1.0.1) as per [Proposal #56](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/56) prepared and tested by [Strangelove Ventures](https://www.strangelove.ventures/). This feature allows multi-hop IBC transfer messages so that a user can send tokens from chain A to chain C via chain B.\n * Bump [Liquidity](https://github.com/gravity-devs/liquidity) module to [v1.4.2](https://github.com/Gravity-Devs/liquidity/releases/tag/v1.4.2) to ensure compatibility with Cosmos-SDK.\n\n### Ready for Production\n\nThese changes have been extensively tested by various Cosmos Core Contributor teams including [Hypha Co-Op](https://hypha.coop/), [Informal Systems Co-Op](https://informal.systems/), [Interchain GmbH](https://interchain.berlin/), [Regen Network](https://regen.network/), [Strangelove Ventures](https://strangelove.ventures/), [Tendermint Inc](https://tendermint.com/) and more. The release candidate for this update was run as a local testnet and a public testnet with a successful upgrade; documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/cosmos/vega-test).\n\n### On-Chain Upgrade Process\n\nWhen the network reaches the halt height, the state machine program of the Cosmos Hub will be halted. The classic method for upgrading requires all validators and node operators to manually substitute the existing state machine binary with the new binary. There is also a newer method that relies on [Cosmovisor](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/tree/master/cosmovisor) to swap the binaries automatically. Cosmovisor also includes the ability to download the binaries automatically before swapping them. Instructions specific to the upgrade can be found [here](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/blob/main/docs/gaia-tutorials/upgrade-node.md). To test a simulated local upgrade please see the [local testnet documentation](https://github.com/cosmos/vega-test/blob/master/local-testnet/README.md). Because it is an onchain upgrade process, the blockchain will be continued with all the accumulated history with continuous block height.\n","plan":{"name":"Vega","time":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","height":"8695000","info":"{\"binaries\":{\"linux/amd64\":\"https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/releases/download/v6.0.0/gaiad-v6.0.0-linux-amd64?checksum=sha256:d9b4391065a338107ca240f29539d62572fe1e85a6c455576afc5e93dba7f402\",\"linux/arm64\":\"https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/releases/download/v6.0.0/gaiad-v6.0.0-linux-arm64?checksum=sha256:e348259fb9ca5d516a8754ea1f15255ef32e7656e79d52a87616edb16f0a7343\",\"darwin/amd64\":\"https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/releases/download/v6.0.0/gaiad-v6.0.0-darwin-amd64?checksum=sha256:e0de182c098ab68d3ef4bab8a3d12aca100b9f1d18d873d66e82ec2c187a1735\",\"windows/amd64\":\"https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/releases/download/v6.0.0/gaiad-v6.0.0-windows-amd64.exe?checksum=sha256:713cb6c1a7ef555d5ed64f036f65b039b44b76f314855e2f7d2a5330568e6100\"}}","upgraded_client_state":null}},"authority":"cosmos10d07y265gmmuvt4z0w9aw880jnsr700j6zn9kn"}],"status":"PROPOSAL_STATUS_PASSED","final_tally_result":{"yes_count":"94563147376928","abstain_count":"6704990415","no_count":"2159900884","no_with_veto_count":"7737790916"},"submit_time":"2021-11-28T19:40:04.622481865Z","deposit_end_time":"2021-12-12T19:40:04.622481865Z","total_deposit":[{"denom":"uatom","amount":"64000000"}],"voting_start_time":"2021-11-29T10:57:56.312883857Z","voting_end_time":"2021-12-13T10:57:56.312883857Z","metadata":"","title":"Vega","summary":"This on-chain upgrade governance proposal is to adopt gaia v6.0.0 which includes a number of updates, fixes and new modules.

Grantees can execute any transaction without the need to maintain sufficient fees.\n     * **NOTICE** It's imortant to highlight [PR #10041](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/10041) which impacts **WALLETS AND EXCHANGES**. This update has removed the deprecated the legacy REST endpoints for broadcast \u0026 encode. **This means `POST /tx` and `POST /txs/encode` no longer work**. Please see the [REST Endpoints Migration guide](https://docs.cosmos.network/master/migrations/rest.html) to migrate to the new REST endpoints.\n * Add [IBC](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go) as a standalone module from the Cosmos SDK using version [v2.0.0](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/releases/tag/v2.0.0). See the [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/v2.0.0/CHANGELOG.md) for details.\n     * Please note that the governance parameter for `MaxExpectedBlockDelay` is set to 30 seconds. This means if a connection is opened with a packet delay of 1 minute, it requires 2 blocks to be committed after the consensus state is submitted before the packet can be processed.\n * Add [packet-forward-middleware](https://github.com/strangelove-ventures/packet-forward-middleware) [v1.0.1](https://github.com/strangelove-ventures/packet-forward-middleware/releases/tag/v1.0.1) as per [Proposal #56](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/56) prepared and tested by [Strangelove Ventures](https://www.strangelove.ventures/). This feature allows multi-hop IBC transfer messages so that a user can send tokens from chain A to chain C via chain B.\n * Bump [Liquidity](https://github.com/gravity-devs/liquidity) module to [v1.4.2](https://github.com/Gravity-Devs/liquidity/releases/tag/v1.4.2) to ensure compatibility with Cosmos-SDK.\n\n### Ready for Production\n\nThese changes have been extensively tested by various Cosmos Core Contributor teams including [Hypha Co-Op](https://hypha.coop/), [Informal Systems Co-Op](https://informal.systems/), [Interchain GmbH](https://interchain.berlin/), [Regen Network](https://regen.network/), [Strangelove Ventures](https://strangelove.ventures/), [Tendermint Inc](https://tendermint.com/) and more. The release candidate for this update was run as a local testnet and a public testnet with a successful upgrade; documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/cosmos/vega-test).\n\n### On-Chain Upgrade Process\n\nWhen the network reaches the halt height, the state machine program of the Cosmos Hub will be halted. The classic method for upgrading requires all validators and node operators to manually substitute the existing state machine binary with the new binary. There is also a newer method that relies on [Cosmovisor](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/tree/master/cosmovisor) to swap the binaries automatically. Cosmovisor also includes the ability to download the binaries automatically before swapping them. Instructions specific to the upgrade can be found [here](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/blob/main/docs/gaia-tutorials/upgrade-node.md). To test a simulated local upgrade please see the [local testnet documentation](https://github.com/cosmos/vega-test/blob/master/local-testnet/README.md). Because it is an onchain upgrade process, the blockchain will be continued with all the accumulated history with continuous block height.\n","proposer":""},{"id":"60","messages":[{"@type":"/cosmos.gov.v1.MsgExecLegacyContent","content":{"@type":"/cosmos.gov.v1beta1.TextProposal","title":"Use EVM (instead of EVMOS) as the symbol for Evmos' native coin","description":"I propose changing the Evmos coin's symbol from EVMOS to EVM because it is shorter and more memorable.\n\nCorrespondingly, the coin's basic unit used in source codes is to be renamed to `uevm`.\n\nThe following table summarizes the proposed naming convention.

The classic method for upgrading requires all validators and node operators to manually substitute the existing state machine binary with the new binary. There is also a newer method that relies on Cosmovisor to swap the binaries automatically. Cosmovisor also includes the ability to download the binaries automatically before swapping them. To test a simulated local upgrade please see the local testnet documentation. Because it is an onchain upgrade process, the blockchain will be continued with all the accumulated history with continuous block height.\r\n\r\nFor full instructions please see https://hub.cosmos.network/main/hub-tutorials/upgrade-node.html\r\n\r### Potential Risk Factors\r\n\r\nAlthough very extensive testing and simulation has taken place there always still exists a risk that the Cosmos Hub might experience problems due to potential bugs or errors from the new features.

By voting YES to this proposal, you approve of adding these \r\n\r\nFor instructions on performing the upgrade see https://hub.cosmos.network/main/hub-tutorials/upgrade-node.html\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\nSince the last v6-Vega upgrade at height 86950000 there have been a number of updates, fixes and new modules added to the Cosmos SDK, IBC and Tendermint.\r\n\r\nThis is a proposal to adopt the first release for the [v7-Theta](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/blob/main/docs/roadmap/cosmos-hub-roadmap-2.0.md#v7-theta-upgrade-expected-q2-2022) upgrade the `cosmoshub-4` mainnet.\r\n\r\nIt contains the following changes:\r\n\r\n- (gaia) bump [cosmos-sdk](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk) to [v0.45.1](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/releases/tag/v0.45.1). See [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.45.1/CHANGELOG.md#v0451---2022-02-03) for details.\r\n- (gaia) bump [ibc-go](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go) module to [v3.0.0](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/releases/tag/v3.0.0). See [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/v3.0.0/CHANGELOG.md#v300---2022-03-15) for details.\r\n- (gaia) add [interhcian account](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/tree/main/modules/apps/27-interchain-accounts) module (interhchain-account module is part of ibc-go module).\r\n- (gaia) bump [liquidity](github.com/gravity-devs/liquidity/x/liquidity) module to [v1.5.0](https://github.com/Gravity-Devs/liquidity/releases/tag/v1.5.0). See [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/Gravity-Devs/liquidity/blob/v1.5.0/CHANGELOG.md#v150---20220223) for details.\r\n- (gaia) bump [packet-forward-middleware](https://github.com/strangelove-ventures/packet-forward-middleware) module to [v2.1.1](https://github.com/strangelove-ventures/packet-forward-middleware/releases/tag/v2.1.1).\r\n- (gaia) add migration logs for upgrade process.\r\n\r\n# On-Chain Upgrade Process\r\nWhen the network reaches the halt height, the state machine program of the Cosmos Hub will be halted. The classic method for upgrading requires all validators and node operators to manually substitute the existing state machine binary with the new binary. There is also a newer method that relies on Cosmovisor to swap the binaries automatically. Cosmovisor also includes the ability to download the binaries automatically before swapping them. To test a simulated local upgrade please see the local testnet documentation. Because it is an onchain upgrade process, the blockchain will be continued with all the accumulated history with continuous block height.\r\n\r\nFor full instructions please see https://hub.cosmos.network/main/hub-tutorials/upgrade-node.html\r\n\r### Potential Risk Factors\r\n\r\nAlthough very extensive testing and simulation has taken place there always still exists a risk that the Cosmos Hub might experience problems due to potential bugs or errors from the new features. In the case of serious problems, validators should stop operating the network immediately. Cosmos Core Contributors will coordinate with validators in the `#validators-verified channel` of the [Cosmos Developer Discord](https://discord.gg/cosmosnetwork) to create and execute a contingency plan.

In this case the proposal deposit is burned rather than being returned to respective depositors.\n\n# Discussion\n## Summary of existing definitions\nThis list summarises the range of ways community members understand the definition of ‘NoWithVeto’. Definitions 2, 3, and 4 are represented in our proposed definition.\n\n1. **As a stronger No:** ‘NoWithVeto’ allows voters to show stronger disagreement than simply voting No.\n2. **As a spam filter:** It provides a means for the community to impose a cost on the depositor for putting forward irrelevant material.\n3. **As a protection of minority interests:** ‘NoWithVeto’ allows a 1/3+ minority who is against the proposal require a 2/3 ‘Yes’ supermajority (rather than a simple \u003e1/2 majority) to pass a proposal, which protects minorities from rule changes they didn't sign up for when joining the community. However this introduces the possibility of gridlock where a minority blocks a governance proposal that the majority wants to pass. Because voting is not private, ‘NoWithVeto’ voters (who likely hold a minority opinion) make themselves potential targets for being forked out of the chain in order for the majority to pass a proposal. Therefore protection of minority interests comes with the acceptance of the risk of being forcibly forked out of the protocol.\n4. **As a means of introducing a cost for proposals made in bad faith:** ‘NoWithVeto’ imposes a consequence for a proposal that does not follow the rules of engagement by ensuring the proposer’s deposit is burned (e.g., a proposal where the description text knowingly misrepresents what the code does).\n5. **As a way to safeguard against censorship:** Since 1/3+ voting power can always block a proposal from passing by censoring transactions as per the underlying consensus mechanism, ‘NoWithVeto’ provides an accountable “in-protocol” method for 1/3+ of the voting power to prevent a proposal from passing. In this way it upholds a core value of blockchain technology: censorship resistance.\n6. **As a way to protect against community divisions:** It allows voters to signal that they would rather exit the network than see the proposal pass. If a significant proportion of the community (i.e., 1/3+ of the participating voting power) are considering leaving the network, the proposal fails, thereby leaving the community intact.\n\n## Censorship\nIt may not always be correct to invoke the underlying consensus mechanism as justification for the 1/3+ ‘NoWithVeto’ threshold: In particular, consensus can be threatened by one third of the **total** voting power (i.e., all staked ATOM) while a proposal can be vetoed by one third of the **participating** voting power (i.e., quorum of 40% of all staked ATOM). Thus the consensus threat requires at least 33.3% of the total voting power to censor transactions or halt the chain, but a governance proposal can be vetoed by only 13.2% of the total voting power when voter turnout is low.\n\n## Financial and social cost\n‘NoWithVeto’ has no immediate additional financial cost to the voters, who can veto a proposal (and thus burn deposits) with a minimum of 13.2% of the voting power. An overuse of ‘NoWithVeto’ may discourage good proposals from being put to a vote as proposers will fear their deposits could be burned.\n\nConsequently voters need social consensus on the meaning of ‘NoWithVeto’ beyond representing a particularly strong ‘No’ vote because in absence of this, there may be no reason to ever vote ‘No’ instead of ‘NoWithVeto’ aside from reputational cost. \n\nWhile there is no financial cost to casting a ‘NoWithVeto’ vote instead of ‘No’, there are potential social and reputational costs in the form of scrutiny and questioning from the community. Since voting isn’t private, ‘Yes’ voters can always coordinate off-chain to remove the stake of those voters who’ve revealed their ‘NoWithVeto’ preference, thereby shutting them out of the chain. In this way, a minority of voters are only able to veto an idea for so long before it becomes potentially attractive to the majority to remove them.\n\n# Conclusion\nWe are proposing that ‘NoWithVeto’ is not “a stronger No” but neither is it a “signal for exit.” Its purpose is to encourage the sharing of ideas and discussion in good faith. Additionally the burn process is intended to impose a cost on spam proposals or those that would cause significant negative impact by way of infringing on minority interests or violating the rules of engagement.\n\nCosmos Hub has a vibrant but young governance system. We hope that ‘NoWithVeto’ can continue to be a valuable tool for good governance.\n\n# Voting options\nWe propose the following definition for ‘NoWithVeto’:\n\n***“A ‘NoWithVeto’ vote indicates a proposal either (1) is deemed to be spam, i.e., irrelevant to Cosmos Hub, (2) disproportionately infringes on minority interests, or (3) violates or encourages violation of the rules of engagement as currently set out by Cosmos Hub governance.”***\n\nYour vote on this proposal indicates the following:\n* **YES** - You agree with the definition of ‘NoWithVeto’ established in this proposal.\n* **NO** - You disagree with the definition of ‘NoWithVeto’ established in this proposal.

Additionally the burn process is intended to impose a cost on spam proposals or those that would cause significant negative impact by way of infringing on minority interests or violating the rules of engagement.\n\nCosmos Hub has a vibrant but young governance system. We hope that ‘NoWithVeto’ can continue to be a valuable tool for good governance.\n\n# Voting options\nWe propose the following definition for ‘NoWithVeto’:\n\n***“A ‘NoWithVeto’ vote indicates a proposal either (1) is deemed to be spam, i.e., irrelevant to Cosmos Hub, (2) disproportionately infringes on minority interests, or (3) violates or encourages violation of the rules of engagement as currently set out by Cosmos Hub governance.”***\n\nYour vote on this proposal indicates the following:\n* **YES** - You agree with the definition of ‘NoWithVeto’ established in this proposal.\n* **NO** - You disagree with the definition of ‘NoWithVeto’ established in this proposal. Please indicate why in the [Cosmos Hub Forum post](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/6898).\n* **NO WITH VETO** - ¯\\\\_(ツ)\\_/¯ If the number of ‘NoWithVeto’ votes is greater than a third of total votes, the proposal is rejected and the deposits are burned.\n* **ABSTAIN** - You wish to contribute to quorum but you formally decline to vote either for or against the proposal.","proposer":""},{"id":"76","messages":[{"@type":"/cosmos.gov.v1.MsgExecLegacyContent","content":{"@type":"/cosmos.gov.v1beta1.TextProposal","title":"## Require a minimum 5% commission for all validator nodes","description":"## Require a minimum 5% commission for all validator nodes.\n\n### Reasoning: Competition drives innovation.

Our members are crypto-native companies and firms that provide industry-specific expertise (legal, consulting, marketing, etc.)\n\nFounded in France in 2020, Adan has over [195 members 6](https://adan.eu/en/association/members) in France and Europe across several industry verticals, including DeFi, payments, market making, custody, data analysis, and security, and is the largest crypto trade organization in Europe.\n\nAdan interacts with all stakeholders with interest in the crypto ecosystem: national and European Members of Parliament, the European Commission, the European Council, the European Parliament, as well as the European Central Bank, and the regulatory bodies and legislators of several European countries.\n\nOur unique positioning allows us to rally decentralized DeFi actors and more traditional listed companies and corporations.\n\n- [Adan Website](https://adan.eu)\n- [Adan on Twitter](https://twitter.com/adan_asso)\n- [Adan on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/adaneu/)\n\n### Mission\n\n- Educate about crypto and help create better narratives around this technology and industry\n- Foster an environment favorable to the growth of the industry\n- Accompany the implementation of French and European regulatory frameworks adapted to the specificities of the sector\n- Build constructive relations between the industry and public institutions\n\n### Team\n\n- Faustine Fleuret: President \u0026 CEO | [Twitter 8](https://twitter.com/faufleuret) / [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/faustine-fleuret-640b67a4/)\n- Mélodie Ambroise: Head of Strategy \u0026 Institutional Relations | [Twitter 3](https://twitter.com/mambroise23) / [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/m%C3%A9lodie-ambroise/)\n- Jules Dubourg: Administrative \u0026 Financial Manager | [Twitter 1](https://twitter.com/Jules_Dubourg) / [Linkedin 1](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jules-dubourg/)\n- Hugo Bordet: Regulatory Affairs Manager | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/HugoBordet1) / [Linkedin 1](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hugo-bordet-598241152/)\n- Dorian Ravaute: Fiscal Affairs Officer |  [Linkedin 1](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dorianravaute/)\n\n### Funding\n\nAdan is a membership organization and is funded primarily through annual fees.\n\nBeing aware that our missions concern not only the Cosmos community but the whole crypto ecosystem, we will ask for grants from other blockchains. Thus the costs will be shared between different communities.\n\nFinally, we will ask the Cosmos community once only. Our growth plan and the opening of the European market will allow us to be financially self-sufficient through membership fees - which today represent over 80% of our annual income.\n\n### Governance\n\nMembers define the yearly objectives during the annual General Assembly. They also vote on the budget, ratify the association's actions, and elect a Board of Directors responsible for representing them and controlling the implementation of these missions.\n\nSee our website for more information about Adan's governance and [Board of Directors 3](https://adan.eu/en/association/governance).\n\nAdan is a non-profit organization registered in France (Association loi de 1901).\n\n### Works \u0026 Publications\n\nAdan interacts with all stakeholders with an interest in the crypto ecosystem: national and European Members of Parliament, the European Commission, the European Council, the European Parliament, as well as the European Central Bank, and the regulatory bodies and legislators of several European countries.\n\nAdan is also involved in discussions with international bodies such as FATF, IOSO, BIS etc.\n\nIn just two short years, Adan has produced an astounding amount of writing and [publications](https://adan.eu/en/publications) to support its mission:\n\n- [A crypto-euro issued by an American giant, or how Europe is delegating its monetary sovereignty](https://adan.eu/en/tribune-les-echos-crypto-euro-en)\n- [EU framework for crypto-asset markets: the French Presidency ends with political deals on MiCA and TFR](https://adan.eu/en/press-release-policy-agreements-mica)\n- [Adan's Response to IOSCO's Retail Market Conduct Report](https://adan.eu/en/consultation/en/response-report-iosco-retail-market)\n- [Adoption of TFR in the European Parliament: the fight against financial crime should not be a fight against crypto-assets](https://adan.eu/en/press/tfr-travel-rule-vote-european-parliament-europeen-econ-libe)\n- [MiCA vote in the European Parliament: A step forward or backward for the crypto sector?](https://adan.eu/en/press-release/european-parliament-mica-compromise-crypto)\n- [Adan responds to the EBA consultation on its draft guidelines for remote onboarding customer solutions 1](https://adan.eu/en/consultation/response-guidelines-eba-onboarding-solutions)\n- [Ban of Proof-of-Work protocols: wrong answer to real global environmental challenges](https://adan.eu/en/position/pow-bitcoin-ban-eu-inappropriate-answer)\n- [Adan's position on FATF's updated guidance for a risk-based approach 1](https://adan.eu/en/position/fatf-updated-guidance-vasp)\n\n## Proposal details\n\nThe crypto industry is evolving rapidly, challenges are multiplying, and public authorities worldwide are increasingly seeking to regulate crypto innovation.\n\nTo this end, we will continue to fight the battles initiated at the French level but must accelerate on the European and international scene according to 4 priorities:\n\n- Monitor upcoming legislation and regulations, such as MiCA, TFR, and the remainder of the AML package.\n- Contribute to elaborating regulatory frameworks in preparation surrounding topics like DeFi, NFTs, the environmental impact of crypto, etc.\n- Establish strong positions on European crypto companies' issues (e.g., access to banking and insurance) and convey them to policymakers.\n- Sensibly educate on regulatory proposals which fail to capture the unique properties of crypto-economic models and risk hindering innovation (e.g., regulating DAOs as legal persons in the traditional sense).\n\nTo overcome these challenges, our team must engage in the following activities:\n\n- Carry out diligent monitoring of the legislative and regulatory agenda\n- Think up pragmatic solutions adapted to the sector within our working groups\n- Dialogue with decision-makers in European institutions (European Commission, Council of the European Union, European Parliament), European authorities (European Central Bank, European Banking Authority, etc.), and international bodies (FATF, IOSCO, BIS, etc.)\n- Create synergies with other market players with shared interests\n\nGiven the size and importance of the mission, which is constantly expanding, Adan must strengthen its team. Thus we request funding from the Cosmos Hub community pool to recruit a European Affairs Officer based in Brussels, allowing us to further increase our ties with transnational bodies.\n\n## Deliverables\n\nWe believe transparency around community funding is important for building trust and establishing a reputation. This is why we pledge to publish progress reports in 6 and 12 months such that the Cosmos Community better understands how funds are spent and may evaluate the return on its investment.\n\nThis report will be delivered to you via this forum.

Our members are crypto-native companies and firms that provide industry-specific expertise (legal, consulting, marketing, etc.)\n\nFounded in France in 2020, Adan has over [195 members 6](https://adan.eu/en/association/members) in France and Europe across several industry verticals, including DeFi, payments, market making, custody, data analysis, and security, and is the largest crypto trade organization in Europe.\n\nAdan interacts with all stakeholders with interest in the crypto ecosystem: national and European Members of Parliament, the European Commission, the European Council, the European Parliament, as well as the European Central Bank, and the regulatory bodies and legislators of several European countries.\n\nOur unique positioning allows us to rally decentralized DeFi actors and more traditional listed companies and corporations.\n\n- [Adan Website](https://adan.eu)\n- [Adan on Twitter](https://twitter.com/adan_asso)\n- [Adan on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/adaneu/)\n\n### Mission\n\n- Educate about crypto and help create better narratives around this technology and industry\n- Foster an environment favorable to the growth of the industry\n- Accompany the implementation of French and European regulatory frameworks adapted to the specificities of the sector\n- Build constructive relations between the industry and public institutions\n\n### Team\n\n- Faustine Fleuret: President \u0026 CEO | [Twitter 8](https://twitter.com/faufleuret) / [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/faustine-fleuret-640b67a4/)\n- Mélodie Ambroise: Head of Strategy \u0026 Institutional Relations | [Twitter 3](https://twitter.com/mambroise23) / [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/m%C3%A9lodie-ambroise/)\n- Jules Dubourg: Administrative \u0026 Financial Manager | [Twitter 1](https://twitter.com/Jules_Dubourg) / [Linkedin 1](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jules-dubourg/)\n- Hugo Bordet: Regulatory Affairs Manager | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/HugoBordet1) / [Linkedin 1](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hugo-bordet-598241152/)\n- Dorian Ravaute: Fiscal Affairs Officer |  [Linkedin 1](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dorianravaute/)\n\n### Funding\n\nAdan is a membership organization and is funded primarily through annual fees.\n\nBeing aware that our missions concern not only the Cosmos community but the whole crypto ecosystem, we will ask for grants from other blockchains. Thus the costs will be shared between different communities.\n\nFinally, we will ask the Cosmos community once only. Our growth plan and the opening of the European market will allow us to be financially self-sufficient through membership fees - which today represent over 80% of our annual income.\n\n### Governance\n\nMembers define the yearly objectives during the annual General Assembly. They also vote on the budget, ratify the association's actions, and elect a Board of Directors responsible for representing them and controlling the implementation of these missions.\n\nSee our website for more information about Adan's governance and [Board of Directors 3](https://adan.eu/en/association/governance).\n\nAdan is a non-profit organization registered in France (Association loi de 1901).\n\n### Works \u0026 Publications\n\nAdan interacts with all stakeholders with an interest in the crypto ecosystem: national and European Members of Parliament, the European Commission, the European Council, the European Parliament, as well as the European Central Bank, and the regulatory bodies and legislators of several European countries.\n\nAdan is also involved in discussions with international bodies such as FATF, IOSO, BIS etc.\n\nIn just two short years, Adan has produced an astounding amount of writing and [publications](https://adan.eu/en/publications) to support its mission:\n\n- [A crypto-euro issued by an American giant, or how Europe is delegating its monetary sovereignty](https://adan.eu/en/tribune-les-echos-crypto-euro-en)\n- [EU framework for crypto-asset markets: the French Presidency ends with political deals on MiCA and TFR](https://adan.eu/en/press-release-policy-agreements-mica)\n- [Adan's Response to IOSCO's Retail Market Conduct Report](https://adan.eu/en/consultation/en/response-report-iosco-retail-market)\n- [Adoption of TFR in the European Parliament: the fight against financial crime should not be a fight against crypto-assets](https://adan.eu/en/press/tfr-travel-rule-vote-european-parliament-europeen-econ-libe)\n- [MiCA vote in the European Parliament: A step forward or backward for the crypto sector?](https://adan.eu/en/press-release/european-parliament-mica-compromise-crypto)\n- [Adan responds to the EBA consultation on its draft guidelines for remote onboarding customer solutions 1](https://adan.eu/en/consultation/response-guidelines-eba-onboarding-solutions)\n- [Ban of Proof-of-Work protocols: wrong answer to real global environmental challenges](https://adan.eu/en/position/pow-bitcoin-ban-eu-inappropriate-answer)\n- [Adan's position on FATF's updated guidance for a risk-based approach 1](https://adan.eu/en/position/fatf-updated-guidance-vasp)\n\n## Proposal details\n\nThe crypto industry is evolving rapidly, challenges are multiplying, and public authorities worldwide are increasingly seeking to regulate crypto innovation.\n\nTo this end, we will continue to fight the battles initiated at the French level but must accelerate on the European and international scene according to 4 priorities:\n\n- Monitor upcoming legislation and regulations, such as MiCA, TFR, and the remainder of the AML package.\n- Contribute to elaborating regulatory frameworks in preparation surrounding topics like DeFi, NFTs, the environmental impact of crypto, etc.\n- Establish strong positions on European crypto companies' issues (e.g., access to banking and insurance) and convey them to policymakers.\n- Sensibly educate on regulatory proposals which fail to capture the unique properties of crypto-economic models and risk hindering innovation (e.g., regulating DAOs as legal persons in the traditional sense).\n\nTo overcome these challenges, our team must engage in the following activities:\n\n- Carry out diligent monitoring of the legislative and regulatory agenda\n- Think up pragmatic solutions adapted to the sector within our working groups\n- Dialogue with decision-makers in European institutions (European Commission, Council of the European Union, European Parliament), European authorities (European Central Bank, European Banking Authority, etc.), and international bodies (FATF, IOSCO, BIS, etc.)\n- Create synergies with other market players with shared interests\n\nGiven the size and importance of the mission, which is constantly expanding, Adan must strengthen its team. Thus we request funding from the Cosmos Hub community pool to recruit a European Affairs Officer based in Brussels, allowing us to further increase our ties with transnational bodies.\n\n## Deliverables\n\nWe believe transparency around community funding is important for building trust and establishing a reputation. This is why we pledge to publish progress reports in 6 and 12 months such that the Cosmos Community better understands how funds are spent and may evaluate the return on its investment.\n\nThis report will be delivered to you via this forum. It will consist of different sections, such as :\n\n- actions carried out in the last months;\n- missions to be carried out in the coming months;\n- distribution of the remaining allocation.\n\n## Funding Amount\n\nTotal amount requested: 8,000 ATOM\n\nThis corresponds to roughly 100,000 EUR and covers gross salary, recruitment costs, and travel expenses for half a year.\n\n## Receipient\n\ncosmos1kdff80vxuj0zmmjauymzjs40hsfkuya79s8tm0\n\n## IPFS\n\nQmR1q2i48EJqaZSXxgggE8VaPKsZFtozVBPHKejMpJAYXx\n\n## Governance Discussion\n\nhttps://forum.cosmos.network/t/proposal-draft-adan-non-profit-fighting-for-sound-crypto-regulation/7416\n\n## Governance votes\n\nThe following items summarize the voting options and what it means for this proposal:\n\n- YES - You agree that persuading regulators to adopt sound and proportional regulation is important and thus wish to fund Adan's work\n- NO - You don't agree that persuading regulators is important and thus do not agree to fund Adan's work\n- NO WITH VETO - A 'NoWithVeto' vote indicates a proposal either (1) is deemed to be spam, i.e., irrelevant to Cosmos Hub, (2) disproportionately infringes on minority interests, or (3) violates or encourages violation of the rules of engagement as currently set out by Cosmos Hub governance.

The proposed solution was to have a direct mint of tokens to a treasury pool.\n\nHowever, the Hub already has a Community Pool that has been used in the past for various community spend proposals. This pool is funded through taxation on a per-block basis. The current tax rate is 2%. By increasing this we can achieve a similar outcome of expanding the pool of funds available for public good funding, without the immediate creation of a new entity or the bulk minting of ATOM.\n\nThis proposal aims to increase inflows to the Community Pool to make it more in line with what we see around the ecosystem and to ensure that funding for future endeavours are secured. This is merely just a first step and more improvements will come later.\n\n## Community Pools comparison\n\nAs a chain, the Cosmos Hub has a fairly small community pool compared to its market capitalisation:\n\nCosmos Hub - 1.24M ATOMs ~ $13M / Market Cap $3.1BN\n\nOsmosis - 52.13M OSMO ~ $60.4M / Market Cap $560M\n\nJuno - 15.73M JUNO ~ $37.3M / Market Cap $150M\n\nStargaze - 445M STARS ~ $20.5M / Market Cap $60M\n\nLooking at other projects across the Cosmos Ecosystem, the Hub has a small community pool compared to its market cap at just 0.41%.\n\nLooking at other ecosystems similar to that of Cosmos, we can find Polkadot (DOT). Polkadot has a market cap of $6.7BN dollars with a treasury pool of roughly 38M DOT which equates to $230M. This figure equates to 3.4% of its total market cap. This large pool of funds is used to fund the growth of the ecosystem through grants, development funding and also community building.\n\nOn the Cosmos Hub these sorts of proposals are hard to come by due to the limited amount of funds of its community pool, and also social cost required to engage with the community. The ATOM 2.0 proposal suggested that a Treasury be created and be bootstrapped with 4M tokens at with every approved vote up to a maximum of 10 tranches. Ultimately the idea of initially minting 4M to the community pool came into the limelight. However, various community members were still uneasy about minting such an amount due to dilution effects.\n\nThe system as it is currently has its flaws but also works. Until consensus on that solution is found regarding the future of inflation and if / when ATOM becomes deflationary, we, **Simply Staking**, are proposing increasing the community pool tax from the current 2% to 10% as that will help bootstrap the community pool organically without too much compromise to inflationary yield.\n\n## Community Pool Tax\n\nCurrent rate of Issuance: 9.6ATOM per block according to x/mint\n\nCurrent amount of blocks per year: 4,360,000\n\nInstead of the current 0.192ATOM being transferred per block to the pool with the 2% tax, with a tax rate set at 10% we would see around 11,460 ATOM per day (0.96 ATOM per block) get moved to the community pool. Over a year this would allocate around ~4.2M ATOM to the community pool.\n\n## How will this increase affect staking rewards?\n\nWith every block, staking rewards are minted. A percentage of those rewards are diverted to the community pool and then the rest to the stakers. Increasing the tax rate from 2% to 10% will decrease the rewards that stakers will receive by around 8% (from roughly 21% right now to 19.4%)\n\nThe premise here is that the value generated by a strong community pool, public good funding and ecosystem development will vastly exceed the yearly single digit % loss in rewards by stakers.\n\n**Link to the Forum discussion** - [Increasing Hub Community Tax](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/proposal-last-call-2022-12-05-increasing-hub-community-tax/8267/90)\n\n**Voting:**\n\n* By voting **YES**, you agree that the community pool tax rate should be changed to 10%.\n* By voting **NO**, you disagree that the community pool tax rate should be changed to 10%.\n* By voting **ABSTAIN**, you express no opinion on the matter.\n* A ‘NoWithVeto’ vote indicates a proposal either (1) is deemed to be spam, i.e., irrelevant to Cosmos Hub, (2) disproportionately infringes on minority interests, or (3) violates or encourages violation of the rules of engagement as currently set out by Cosmos Hub governance","changes":[{"subspace":"distribution","key":"communitytax","value":"\"0.10000000000000000\""}]},"authority":"cosmos10d07y265gmmuvt4z0w9aw880jnsr700j6zn9kn"}],"status":"PROPOSAL_STATUS_PASSED","final_tally_result":{"yes_count":"116105830396111","abstain_count":"1840742218391","no_count":"787124370647","no_with_veto_count":"68993939656"},"submit_time":"2022-12-05T16:09:13.674181545Z","deposit_end_time":"2022-12-19T16:09:13.674181545Z","total_deposit":[{"denom":"uatom","amount":"64000000"}],"voting_start_time":"2022-12-05T16:13:13.345597640Z","voting_end_time":"2022-12-19T16:13:13.345597640Z","metadata":"","title":"Increase the Community Pool Tax on the Cosmos Hub - Parameter Change","summary":"# Increase Community Pool Tax Rate\n\n*Authors:* [Simply Staking](https://twitter.com/SimplyStaking)\n\n## Summary\n\nThe aim of this proposal is to increase the community tax rate from the current 2% to 10% with the aim of increasing inflows to the community pool in order to help with future funding that brings utility to the Cosmos Hub.\n\n## Background\n\nOver the past couple of weeks, there have been a lot of fruitful yet sometimes heated discussions regarding the funding model for the Cosmos Hub.\n\n‘Why do we need to create a treasury’ was asked regarding a proposed overhaul of the tokenomics model of the Hub and oftentimes the general consensus would be that it’s to future proof funding for the Cosmos Hub and anything that would need to be built or funded.

And a range of more specific, actionable insights on how to improve community health. We cant say what the specific insights are before doing the research, though.\n## About RnDAO\nWe're an R\u0026D DAO with a mission to empower humane collaboration. Having already delivered research projects on sub-DAOs, DAO Conceptual Foundations, Decentralised Leadership, DAO Compensation and more: http:// rndao.mirror.xyz\n## Abstract\nLike many others, Cosmos depends on the health of its community and its vibez—yet understanding and measuring these factors (what we call Community Health) is challenging.\nToday, Web3 communities are left to rely on infrequent transactions data (on-chain records), while data from the significantly more frequent social interactions is limited to basic indicators of Discord or Discourse, Web2-oriented bots like Statsbot that give simplistic measurements, or a patchwork of “homemade” surveys to fill in the gaps. These solutions are ill-suited for DAO communities, surveys are time-consuming for community managers and contributors to use, and the results of these approaches, hampered by poor indicators and/or poor sampling, are unreliable.\nPerhaps even direr, the lack of real-time analytics leaves DAO community leaders and members without established baselines to measure against to understand the impact of community-focused initiatives, identify best practices, monitor shocks to the system, or rapidly gauge the effects of system-wide changes (such as market crashes, protocol migrations, etc.).\n## Specification\nFor the conceptual framework, we have assembled a team including two PhDs in network science and an organisation designer with significant DAO and community building experience to bridge both theory and practice. We've reviewed over 50 papers on the topics of Community, Social Network Analysis, Resilience, Trust, Engagement, and more. And are synthesising all of these findings to define the key indicators that have high validity and high predictive capacity for community health, while also taking a holistic perspective that accounts for member's wellbeing and planning to collect data across communities to offer an ecosystem health scrore too.\nFor the data collection tool, we're going beyond traditional surveys.\nThis research proposal focuses on the use of two critical techniques as a starting point:\nOrganizational Network Analysis (ONA) is a structured way to visualize how communications, information, and value creation occur through an organization based on interaction graphs. ONA has been shown to provide a wide range of insights to improve contributor retention, avoid member burnout, predict team performance and community resilience, identify key contributors, enable decentralization, and improve coordination. Although relatively new, ONA is gaining in popularity over traditional survey tools.\nPulse Surveys are frequent and automated micro-surveys that provide qualitative and quantitative insights. In traditional organizations, they have been shown to increase employee response rate and employee engagement with related initiatives. They're also used as a tool for culture design and implementing culture change. Lastly, Pulse Surveys significantly reduce admin work for community managers and related roles. Importantly, these surveys offer an opt-out option from future prompts and are also framed to leverage coaching techniques to offer a prompt for reflection, thus offering value to participants as a recentering exercise on the value of community.\nThe data is anonymised and collected in a central repository for this first phase (we're exploring decentralised hosting) and managed by a team having received ethics training and at risk of losing their credentials should it be misused.\n## Rationale\nThe techniques used (ONA based on communication and Pulse Surveys) provide maximum insights on Community Health compared with exclusively on-chain data analysis. And provide minimum disruption for community members and minimal admin compared to long-form surveys and user interviews. Crucially, the techniques selected and the usage of Discord messages increase participation by those less likely to respond to long surveys e.g. those less engaged and thus likely with the most valuable feedback to give.\nAlthough our initial focus is Community Health metrics, the proposed approach sets the foundation for further applications. Some of the potential applications and insights for Cosmos Hub and Cosmos-Chains-based DAOs are:\n* Generate baseline metrics for Community Health / vibez to quantify and better understand the impact that a specific event is having on a community and/or sub-groups within the community\n* Predict which contributors are likely to leave the DAO and take preventive action (without breaching privacy\n* Build funnels to track member onboarding and identify areas for improvement\n* Identify measurements of decentralization to serve as KPIs or Insights metrics\n* Monitor specific topics like contributor wellbeing, alignment, community experience, etc. in near real-time\n* Attract talent and investment with objective Community Health metrics instead of proxy metrics like member count or proposal count, or financial metrics such as TVL\nIn addition to the initial research on Community Health, the potential applications mentioned above can enable more effective and targeted efforts to build healthier DAO communities.\n## Why our Team\nTeam Leads\nKaterinabc\nPh.D. in Team Dynamics using Social Network Analysis, Teaching Collaboration, and Organizational Performance at Northwestern University (since 2016).\nCo-organized Learning in Networks sessions at the International Conference of Social Network Analysis (2018 - 2020), and previously advised a people analytics company on social network metrics.\nThegadget.eth\nSoftware Engineer.

To boost the IBC NFT ecosystem, we’re proposing to launch a Game of NFTs event, which will build on the success of previous programs including [Game of Stakes 6](https://github.com/cosmos/game-of-stakes) and [Game of Zones 1](https://goz.cosmosnetwork.dev/), as well as the ongoing [Game of Chains 1](https://github.com/hyphacoop/ics-testnets/tree/main/game-of-chains-2022).

This phase is scheduled for around February 2023. \n* Phase 2: A Hackathon, for developers to create tools, dApps and use cases around Interchain NFTs. This phase is scheduled for around March 2023. \n\n## Public Incentivized Testnets - Phase 1 \n\nMany talented teams are contributing to the IBC NFT ecosystem, and have plans to deploy this Interchain NFTs technology. To facilitate wide adoption and successful deployment to capture more value to the Interchain, Phase 1 of the Game of NFTs event is designed to provide mainnet-like environments for purposes on a) testing the performance and capability of Interchain NFTs feature, and b) building trust in Interchain NFTs and preparing for its deployment in the mainnet environments. \n\nThe Interchain NFTs technology is crucial to facilitate interoperability and use cases of IBC, and will capture more value and use cases for both Cosmos-SDK and Wasm chains in Cosmos. By bringing this proposal up, we believe in the Interchain, Cosmos Hub is always a pioneer that takes the lead to pays attention to innovative technologies and public goods that can enhance IBC, Cosmos SDK and more underlying technologies, which is crucial to Cosmos Hub, Cosmos chains and also the Interchain. We would like to bring more value to the Interchain and there is no better way to do this than by having support from Cosmos Hub to Cosmos teams and communities to join the testing and improve this technology jointly. \n\nFor this reason, we believe it’s crucial to have testnets environment for Cosmos teams and communities to participate, as well well to reward participants who help contribute through the testing to the Interchain, we’re seeking community approval for 20K ATOMs withdrawn for the community pool as incentives for the GoN Phase 1 - Public Incentivized Testnet. \n\n* 50% (10K ATOM) of the prize pool will be reserved for Phase 1 participants who complete Public Incentivized Testnet tasks with a set point system that is allocated based on their scores. These tasks and the point system will be published at the launch of the testnet. \n* The remaining 50% (10K ATOM) will be reserved for bonuses to Phase 1 participants who help identify bugs or performance issues or help develop new tools and monitoring solutions at the discretion of the board of judges \n* Funds will be managed by a 2/3 multisig committee \n* Any unused funds will be returned to the community pool \n\nGame of NFTs is a joint effort by the Interchain ecosystem, so certainly, in addition to the support from the Cosmos community pool to advance the infrastructure and underlying technology, there will be various support from Cosmos projects such as IRISnet, Stargaze, Juno and other teams, and also from organizations such as IDG Capital and HashKey Capital. There will be multi-team support from their community pools, to sponsor the prize pool of Phase 2 Hackathon that is boosting applications on top of this infrastructure and technology. \n\nThrough collaborative efforts of the Cosmos teams and community, this whole event will bring out verified Interchain NFTs infrastructure and technology that can be simply used and adopted by Cosmos chains, and prompt the creation of various pioneer applications using the technology, which together will create a complete IBC NFT ecosystem from bottom-up for the Interchain, and quickly expand the mind and market share for Cosmos. \n\n## Board of Judges \n\n* Susannah Evans | IBC Product Lead, ICF \n* Haifeng Xi | CTO, Bianjie \n* Shane Vitarana | Co-founder, Stargaze \n* Deborah Simper | Co-founder, Gravity Bridge \n* Jeffrey Hu | Tech Lead, HashKey Capital \n\n## Multisig Committee \n\n* Haifeng Xi | CTO, Bianjie \n* Michael Scotto | Bridge Engineer, Stargaze \n* Jeffrey Hu | Tech Lead, HashKey Capital \n\n## Recipient \n\ncosmos152dcrzkyhqg48tng79x2jr8za4yg452kneuvwa \n\n## Amount \n\n20000 ATOMs \n\n## Forum post link \n\n[https://forum.cosmos.network/t/proposal-draft-fund-incentives-for-the-interchain-nfts-public-incentivized-testnets-of-game-of-nfts/8638/1](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/proposal-draft-fund-incentives-for-the-interchain-nfts-public-incentivized-testnets-of-game-of-nfts/8638/1) \n\n## Voting \n\n* By voting YES on this proposal, you indicate support for funding the Interchain NFTs public testnets incentives that will be managed by a multisig committee \n* By voting NO on this proposal, you do not support this proposal in its current form - please kindly indicate why by leaving comments in the Cosmos Forum. \n* By voting ABSTAIN, you formally decline to vote either for or against the proposal but want to contribute to the quorum. \n* By voting NOWITHVETO, you express that you consider this proposal malicious or harmful and you would like to see depositors penalized by revocation of the deposit, which contributes towards an automatic 1/3 veto threshold.","recipient":"cosmos152dcrzkyhqg48tng79x2jr8za4yg452kneuvwa","amount":[{"denom":"uatom","amount":"20000000000"}]},"authority":"cosmos10d07y265gmmuvt4z0w9aw880jnsr700j6zn9kn"}],"status":"PROPOSAL_STATUS_PASSED","final_tally_result":{"yes_count":"85878376598815","abstain_count":"21099223663264","no_count":"647647689904","no_with_veto_count":"10645962836"},"submit_time":"2023-01-06T04:04:35.514710335Z","deposit_end_time":"2023-01-20T04:04:35.514710335Z","total_deposit":[{"denom":"uatom","amount":"250000100"}],"voting_start_time":"2023-01-06T06:05:44.670893959Z","voting_end_time":"2023-01-20T06:05:44.670893959Z","metadata":"","title":"Fund Incentives for the Interchain NFTs Public Incentivized Testnets of Game of NFTs","summary":"# Fund Incentives for the Interchain NFTs Public Incentivized Testnets of Game of NFTs \n\n# Summary \n\nThe Game of NFTs (GoN) is an event proposed as a joint effort by multiple Cosmos teams, aiming to test the Interchain NFTs feature and build applications on top of it, which will have 2 phases: a) public incentivized testnets and b) a hackathon.

and\n - Losing developers to other L1s.\n\nThe grant program solves these problems through:\n - Liaising between decentralized teams;\n - Minimizing risk through due diligence;\n - Supporting teams already growing the Hub;\n - Bringing new developers to the Hub and;\n - Efficiently deploying capital to ensure R\u0026D \u0026 growth at the Hub.\n\n\u003cB\u003eThe Team\u003c/B\u003e \n\n\u003cB\u003eA.

See the full [Changelog](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/v3.4.0/CHANGELOG.md) for more information.\r\n- Bump [Cosmos SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk) to `v0.45.12` from `v0.45.9`.

In a previous upgrade, the `x/bank` metadata was incorrectly migrated, resulting in an incorrect bank metadata. See the fix in the [upgrade handler](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/blob/release/v8.0.x/app/upgrades/v8/upgrades.go#L19) for more information. \r\n- Fix Quicksilver ICA exploit detailed in the [forum post](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/upcoming-interchain-accounts-bugfix-release/8911) on the incident.

For more information, see the testnet [upgrade proposal](https://explorer.theta-testnet.polypore.xyz/proposals/112) or [block explorer](https://explorer.theta-testnet.polypore.xyz/), and visit the [persistent testnet documentation](https://github.com/cosmos/testnets/tree/master/public).\r\n\r\n#### On-Chain Upgrade Process\r\n\r\nThis upgrade can be performed in multiple ways. When the network reaches the halt height, the state machine program of the Cosmos Hub will be halted. The classic method for upgrading requires all validators and node operators to manually substitute the existing state machine binary with the new binary. Alternatively node operators can use the Cosmovisor utility to swap the binaries automatically. Cosmovisor also includes the ability to download the binaries automatically *before* swapping them. Documentation on Cosmovisor can be found [here](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/tree/main/tools/cosmovisor). If you are interested in trying Cosmosvisor with a simulated local upgrade please see the [local testnet documentation](https://github.com/cosmos/testnets/tree/master/local). Because it is an onchain upgrade process, the blockchain will be continued with all the accumulated history with continuous block height.\r\n\r\n#### Potential Risk Factors\r\n\r\nAlthough very extensive testing and simulation has taken place there always still exists a risk that the Cosmos Hub might experience problems due to potential bugs or errors from the new features. In the case of serious problems, validators should stop operating the network immediately. Cosmos Core Contributors will coordinate with validators in the `#validators-verified channel` of the [Cosmos Developer Discord](https://discord.gg/cosmosnetwork) to create and execute a contingency plan. Likely this will be an emergency release with fixes or the recommendation to consider the upgrade aborted and revert back to the previous release of gaia (v7.1.0).","plan":{"name":"v8-Rho","time":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","height":"14099412","info":"{\"binaries\":{\"linux/amd64\":\"https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/releases/download/v8.0.0/gaiad-v8.0.0-linux-amd64?checksum=sha256:6d0c123e246a8b56ba534f70dd5dc72058b00fd5e5dde5ea40509ff51efc42e2\",\"linux/arm64\":\"https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/releases/download/v8.0.0/gaiad-v8.0.0-linux-arm64?checksum=sha256:a0afbbe35eda3d5e52a7907bcae296415e84b3ff6c7da97429d91f324004a5ab\",\"darwin/amd64\":\"https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/releases/download/v8.0.0/gaiad-v8.0.0-darwin-amd64?checksum=sha256:e66c0e62aa5b0ccf9fb174c50b598df6048c1d7952f5f99b807b9934c9629f2c\",\"darwin/arm64\":\"https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/releases/download/v8.0.0/gaiad-v8.0.0-darwin-arm64?checksum=sha256:95000b52f55f22e1b40b81263bc0ae0df1351e8b9b40264c54509ad1e4d6e9fb\",\"windows/amd64\":\"https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/releases/download/v8.0.0/gaiad-v8.0.0-windows-amd64.exe?checksum=sha256:fca2a4371eef6dc50b6b46a025bde3537fa96ec32c732499c8be8aa64683f147\"}}","upgraded_client_state":null}},"authority":"cosmos10d07y265gmmuvt4z0w9aw880jnsr700j6zn9kn"}],"status":"PROPOSAL_STATUS_PASSED","final_tally_result":{"yes_count":"127718926041581","abstain_count":"597316401656","no_count":"19246143625","no_with_veto_count":"3310925845"},"submit_time":"2023-01-31T17:29:18.393359627Z","deposit_end_time":"2023-02-14T17:29:18.393359627Z","total_deposit":[{"denom":"uatom","amount":"250001000"}],"voting_start_time":"2023-01-31T18:14:06.419112545Z","voting_end_time":"2023-02-14T18:14:06.419112545Z","metadata":"","title":"v8-Rho","summary":"# v8-Rho Software Upgrade\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nThis on-chain upgrade governance proposal is to adopt Gaia `v8.0.0`.

For more information, see the testnet [upgrade proposal](https://explorer.theta-testnet.polypore.xyz/proposals/112) or [block explorer](https://explorer.theta-testnet.polypore.xyz/), and visit the [persistent testnet documentation](https://github.com/cosmos/testnets/tree/master/public).\r\n\r\n#### On-Chain Upgrade Process\r\n\r\nThis upgrade can be performed in multiple ways. When the network reaches the halt height, the state machine program of the Cosmos Hub will be halted. The classic method for upgrading requires all validators and node operators to manually substitute the existing state machine binary with the new binary. Alternatively node operators can use the Cosmovisor utility to swap the binaries automatically. Cosmovisor also includes the ability to download the binaries automatically *before* swapping them. Documentation on Cosmovisor can be found [here](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/tree/main/tools/cosmovisor). If you are interested in trying Cosmosvisor with a simulated local upgrade please see the [local testnet documentation](https://github.com/cosmos/testnets/tree/master/local). Because it is an onchain upgrade process, the blockchain will be continued with all the accumulated history with continuous block height.\r\n\r\n#### Potential Risk Factors\r\n\r\nAlthough very extensive testing and simulation has taken place there always still exists a risk that the Cosmos Hub might experience problems due to potential bugs or errors from the new features. In the case of serious problems, validators should stop operating the network immediately. Cosmos Core Contributors will coordinate with validators in the `#validators-verified channel` of the [Cosmos Developer Discord](https://discord.gg/cosmosnetwork) to create and execute a contingency plan. Likely this will be an emergency release with fixes or the recommendation to consider the upgrade aborted and revert back to the previous release of gaia (v7.1.0).","proposer":""},{"id":"98","messages":[{"@type":"/cosmos.gov.v1.MsgExecLegacyContent","content":{"@type":"/cosmos.distribution.v1beta1.CommunityPoolSpendProposal","title":"ATOM GROWTH DAO Growth \u0026 Developer Acquisition 2023","description":"## Change log\n\n* 2023-02-4 New post after a feedback cycle\n\n## Summary\n\nOn-chain submission redacted for length.

If it passes, it will transfer the ATOM equivalent of $1.25M  to support the Confio team in their stewardship of CosmWasm, CosmJS, and many other related repos. This is 95 697 ATOM at the current 30-day moving average price.\n\n This is based on a forum discussion about providing a total of $2.5M of support in two tranches to Confio. Confio will most likely apply for a second tranche in August, but the size requested will be adjusted by any other funding we have secured in the meantime, as we are applying for other sources.\n\nForum Discussion: [https://forum.cosmos.network/t/proposal-last-call-2023-02-13-confio-public-goods-funding/9677/2](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/proposal-last-call-2023-02-13-confio-public-goods-funding/9677/2)\n\nFull Proposal Text: [https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmTYBVYadb4WmhZjq5Vo7hSmFXdxBdcPowVa6nnh1HCMPu](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmTYBVYadb4WmhZjq5Vo7hSmFXdxBdcPowVa6nnh1HCMPu)\n\n## Purpose\n*Strengthening the ATOM Economic Zone through support and Public Goods.*\n\nConfio is the team responsible for the stewardship and development of a huge number of libraries fundamental to many developers in the Cosmos. The best known are the CosmJS \u0026 CosmWasm libraries, two key components of the Cosmos software stack, but you can review the [list of dozens of repositories](https://github.com/confio/funding/blob/main/Repositories.md) Confio maintains. These libraries are highly valued by developers and chains across the Cosmos ecosystem. In addition, they focus on expanding IBC protocols by developing IBC-enabled contracts and training others how to do so as well.\n\nConfio is also prepared to offer some services and support for the success of Cosmos Hub secured consumer chains in exchange for such funding support. This will be defined more below, but it should be clear that there are also tangible benefits for the Cosmos Hub through this proposal. ## Use of Funds\nConfio currently has a burn rate of circa 230k USD/month with around 90% of outgoing payments going to salaries.

If it passes, it will transfer the ATOM equivalent of $1.25M  to support the Confio team in their stewardship of CosmWasm, CosmJS, and many other related repos. This is 95 697 ATOM at the current 30-day moving average price.\n\n This is based on a forum discussion about providing a total of $2.5M of support in two tranches to Confio. Confio will most likely apply for a second tranche in August, but the size requested will be adjusted by any other funding we have secured in the meantime, as we are applying for other sources.\n\nForum Discussion: [https://forum.cosmos.network/t/proposal-last-call-2023-02-13-confio-public-goods-funding/9677/2](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/proposal-last-call-2023-02-13-confio-public-goods-funding/9677/2)\n\nFull Proposal Text: [https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmTYBVYadb4WmhZjq5Vo7hSmFXdxBdcPowVa6nnh1HCMPu](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmTYBVYadb4WmhZjq5Vo7hSmFXdxBdcPowVa6nnh1HCMPu)\n\n## Purpose\n*Strengthening the ATOM Economic Zone through support and Public Goods.*\n\nConfio is the team responsible for the stewardship and development of a huge number of libraries fundamental to many developers in the Cosmos. The best known are the CosmJS \u0026 CosmWasm libraries, two key components of the Cosmos software stack, but you can review the [list of dozens of repositories](https://github.com/confio/funding/blob/main/Repositories.md) Confio maintains. These libraries are highly valued by developers and chains across the Cosmos ecosystem. In addition, they focus on expanding IBC protocols by developing IBC-enabled contracts and training others how to do so as well.\n\nConfio is also prepared to offer some services and support for the success of Cosmos Hub secured consumer chains in exchange for such funding support. This will be defined more below, but it should be clear that there are also tangible benefits for the Cosmos Hub through this proposal. ## Use of Funds\nConfio currently has a burn rate of circa 230k USD/month with around 90% of outgoing payments going to salaries. All funds from this proposal will go to pay salaries of employees. Principally developers, but also marketing/community building work (for the conference) and internal support (HR / accounting) needed to keep the company running.\n\nOur headcount has been reducing and as of the end of February 2023, we will have 20 employees, including 10 developers and 1 product owner (one more if Ethan gets to code again and stop fundraising).

The feature being discussed here is in this family, but more accurately termed “Replicated Security”. In the past it has been referred to as Interchain Security v1, or ICS, but going forward we refer to it as Replicated Security.*\n\n## Summary\nThis on-chain upgrade governance proposal is to adopt . By voting YES to this proposal, you approve of adding these updates to the Cosmos Hub.  \n\nThe Cosmos Hub is upgrading its security system with a new feature called Replicated Security. This will allow the Cosmos Hub to provide its strong security to other blockchains, which are called 'consumer chains'. The cost to censor or control a consumer chain with an economic attack is the same as the cost to censor or control the Cosmos Hub itself. This means that consumer chains can benefit from the Cosmos Hub's security without having to maintain their own validator sets.  \n\nReplicated Security works through the IBC protocol. Consumer chains receive periodic IBC packets containing the up-to-date validator set of the Cosmos Hub and use this to update their own validator sets, effectively replicating the Hub's validator set. This means that the Cosmos Hub's validators can validate multiple chains at once with the same stake.  \n\nIn exchange for this service, consumer chains are expected to send a portion of their fees and inflation to the Cosmos Hub validators and delegators. These tokens will then be included as part of the Cosmos Hub's staking rewards.\n\n## Software details\n### Updates\n* (feat) Add [Interchain-Security](https://github.com/cosmos/interchain-security) [v1.0.0](https://github.com/cosmos/interchain-security/releases/tag/v1.0.0) provider module. See the [ICS Spec](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc/blob/main/spec/app/ics-028-cross-chain-validation/README.md) for more details.\n* (gaia) Bump [cosmos-sdk](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk) to [v0.45.13-ics](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/releases/tag/v0.45.13-ics).

Imports Interchain-Security's  and implements Gaia as the provider chain.\n\n### On-Chain Upgrade Process\nWhen the network reaches the halt height, the state machine program of the Cosmos Hub will be halted. The classic method for upgrading requires all validators and node operators to manually substitute the existing state machine binary with the new binary.  \n\nAlternatively node operators can use the Cosmovisor utility to swap the binaries automatically. Cosmovisor also includes the ability to download the binaries automatically before swapping them. Documentation on Cosmovisor can be found [here](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/tree/main/tools/cosmovisor). If you are interested in trying Cosmosvisor with a simulated local upgrade please see the [local testnet documentation](https://github.com/cosmos/testnets/tree/master/local).\n\n### Potential Risk Factors\nAlthough very extensive testing and simulation has taken place there always still exists a risk that the Cosmos Hub might experience problems due to potential bugs or errors from the new features. In the case of serious problems, validators should stop operating the network immediately.  \n\nCosmos Core Contributors will coordinate with validators in the #validators-verified channel of the [Cosmos Developer Discord](https://discord.gg/cosmosnetwork) to create and execute a contingency plan. Likely this will be an emergency release with fixes or the recommendation to consider the upgrade aborted and revert back to the previous release of gaia (v8.0.1).\n\n## Governance votes\nThe following items summarize the voting options and what it means for this proposal:\n\n* YES - You approve of adding these updates to the Cosmos Hub.\n* NO - You don’t approve of adding these updates to the Cosmos Hub. Please indicate why on the Cosmos Hub forum.\n* NO WITH VETO - A ‘NoWithVeto’ vote indicates a proposal either (1) is deemed to be spam, i.e., irrelevant to Cosmos Hub, (2) disproportionately infringes on minority interests, or (3) violates or encourages violation of the rules of engagement as currently set out by Cosmos Hub governance. If the number of ‘NoWithVeto’ votes is greater than a third of total votes, the proposal is rejected and the deposits are burned.\n* ABSTAIN - You wish to contribute to quorum but you formally decline to vote either for or against the proposal.\n\n## Appendix: Replicated Security\n### Changes to this proposal\nThis proposal went onto the governance forum in mid-December. Since that time, we have made one change to the protocol. In response to the only high-severity finding in the Informal audit report (see 'Testing and audits below'), and feedback from the community, we have made it so that the slashing and tombstoning of validators for offenses on consumer chains must be approved by a governance vote. This will have a [very minimal impact](https://informal.systems/blog/governance-gated-vs-automatic-equivocation-slashing) on the operation and security of consumer chains while protecting the Cosmos Hub from possibility of an attack by a rogue consumer chain.  \n\nThis governance gating is temporary until the Cosmos Hub is able to cryptographically verify proof of double signing in an upcoming release of Replicated Security. This does not give governance the ability to slash validators arbitrarily, but rather to approve slash packets that have already been transmitted from a consumer chain.\n\n### The ATOM economic zone\nIt is anticipated that consumer chains using Replicated Security will collaborate closely in an 'ATOM economic zone'. This is expected to have a snowball effect, with the Cosmos Hub securing a growing group of high-value decentralized protocols. Already, some prominent projects such as a smart-contracting platform, an AMM, several liquid staking providers and others have expressed interest in using Replicated Security from the Cosmos Hub.  \n\nReplicated Security can also be used to further the cause of “Hub minimalism”. Any new features to the Hub, even if they are core to the Hub's functionality, can be launched as consumer chains. This allows the Hub to scale better and separate release cycles, enabling faster deployment of new features.\n\n### Onboarding a consumer chain\nThis governance proposal will not launch any consumer chains on its own. Instead, it will only add the necessary code to the Cosmos Hub to enable Replicated Security. In order to launch, each consumer chain must submit their own governance proposal to be voted on separately.  \n\nIt is expected that before launch, a consumer chain will have participated in a Cosmos Hub Replicated Security testnet, conducted their own testnets, and undergone an audit by reputable auditors.  \n\nOnce a consumer chain proposal passes, Cosmos Hub validators can begin running the consumer chain and receiving rewards. The chain will only start if more than two-thirds (by power) of the Cosmos Hub validators decide to run the consumer chain.\n\n### Offboarding a consumer chain\nOnce the consumer chain is running, validators can be slashed and jailed for consensus faults such as downtime and double signing on the consumer chain.  \n\nAt any point in time, one-third (by power) of the Cosmos Hub validators will be able to stop running the consumer chain at once: the chain will halt, and none of them will be slashed for downtime.  \n\nThe offboardings of consumer chains will have strong social norms to protect both sides, and any kind of forceful exit will only be coordinated in extreme cases such as protocol failures or attacks.  \n\nFor normal cases, a separate governance proposal will be made to remove a consumer chain, which will allow Cosmos Hub validators to stop running it.\n\n### Further resources and information:\n#### Archival links\n* [IPFS pin of unabridged proposal text](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmY7h5BV725yifQavezbLVPM7nhG5UGpwk7pALEw8GNcU9)\n* [Forum discussion](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/proposal-draft-v9-lambda-upgrade-with-replicated-security/8766)\n\n#### Essays and detailed feature explanations\n* [Preparing for Replicated Security](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/preparing-for-replicated-security/8925)\n* [Governance-Gated Slashing vs Automatic Equivocation Slashing](https://informal.systems/blog/governance-gated-vs-automatic-equivocation-slashing)\n\n#### Testing and audits\n* [Informal Systems Audit team results](https://informal.systems/replicated-security-audit.pdf)\n* [Findings from Game of Chains and Beyond](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/findings-from-game-of-chains-and-beyond/9720)\n* [ICS software tests](https://github.com/cosmos/interchain-security/tree/main/tests)","plan":{"name":"v9-Lambda","time":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","height":"14470501","info":"{\"binaries\":{\"linux/amd64\":\"https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/releases/download/v9.0.0/gaiad-v9.0.0-linux-amd64?checksum=sha256:082b8d8b6da364b3d981a6e12822dcc260326b1f0948eb9fe3d7798f0ff76c1e\",\"linux/arm64\":\"https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/releases/download/v9.0.0/gaiad-v9.0.0-linux-arm64?checksum=sha256:c07cafc8afdbba962d6dd41a913c72aafa2c94c0c77f12604f931ef03d33c208\",\"darwin/amd64\":\"https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/releases/download/v9.0.0/gaiad-v9.0.0-darwin-amd64?checksum=sha256:d24249ba4de991fc8a90bf0798445e4dc27973e684ccdd4f7995327ac19cb0f1\",\"darwin/arm64\":\"https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/releases/download/v9.0.0/gaiad-v9.0.0-darwin-arm64?checksum=sha256:fddb84763759b62ab1c6044c38b003c7cbd0cea82eac5e99e6bee6f03ed83dcf\",\"windows/amd64\":\"https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/releases/download/v9.0.0/gaiad-v9.0.0-windows-amd64.exe?checksum=sha256:c540b9273be49e846084f9190db0dea3b66334b7dd220d832848c25d5fbf5098\"}}","upgraded_client_state":null}},"authority":"cosmos10d07y265gmmuvt4z0w9aw880jnsr700j6zn9kn"}],"status":"PROPOSAL_STATUS_PASSED","final_tally_result":{"yes_count":"116247542408437","abstain_count":"597568678172","no_count":"11181672345","no_with_veto_count":"4604639776"},"submit_time":"2023-02-21T16:55:43.122735120Z","deposit_end_time":"2023-03-07T16:55:43.122735120Z","total_deposit":[{"denom":"uatom","amount":"250021000"}],"voting_start_time":"2023-02-21T17:08:29.018900762Z","voting_end_time":"2023-03-07T17:08:29.018900762Z","metadata":"","title":"v9-Lambda","summary":"# V9 Lambda upgrade (with Replicated Security)\n\n***Terminology note:** Interchain Security is the name for a family of protocols. The feature being discussed here is in this family, but more accurately termed “Replicated Security”. In the past it has been referred to as Interchain Security v1, or ICS, but going forward we refer to it as Replicated Security.*\n\n## Summary\nThis on-chain upgrade governance proposal is to adopt . By voting YES to this proposal, you approve of adding these updates to the Cosmos Hub.  \n\nThe Cosmos Hub is upgrading its security system with a new feature called Replicated Security. This will allow the Cosmos Hub to provide its strong security to other blockchains, which are called 'consumer chains'. The cost to censor or control a consumer chain with an economic attack is the same as the cost to censor or control the Cosmos Hub itself. This means that consumer chains can benefit from the Cosmos Hub's security without having to maintain their own validator sets.  \n\nReplicated Security works through the IBC protocol. Consumer chains receive periodic IBC packets containing the up-to-date validator set of the Cosmos Hub and use this to update their own validator sets, effectively replicating the Hub's validator set. This means that the Cosmos Hub's validators can validate multiple chains at once with the same stake.  \n\nIn exchange for this service, consumer chains are expected to send a portion of their fees and inflation to the Cosmos Hub validators and delegators. These tokens will then be included as part of the Cosmos Hub's staking rewards.\n\n## Software details\n### Updates\n* (feat) Add [Interchain-Security](https://github.com/cosmos/interchain-security) [v1.0.0](https://github.com/cosmos/interchain-security/releases/tag/v1.0.0) provider module.

At Spark IBC, we believe that, currently, “Cosmos” and the greater Interchain are extremely fragmented, as communities, educational resources, NFT collections, Dapps and tools each reside in their own remote corners of the ecosystem.\n\nICI aims to change this by taking the first step toward building the unified, multi-chain future that the community has been waiting for, and that we believe is paramount to Cosmos gaining mass adoption in the next market cycle. We are currently running an ICI funding campaign on the Spark IBC platform, found here, [https://sparkibc.zone](https://sparkibc.zone) 4 along with more details about ICI itself.\n\nWe are avoiding VCs and private investors in this endeavor, because ICI is only a valuable resource if it remains unbiased and beholden to no one but the community that uses it. Therefore, all ICI costs so far have come out of our own pockets, and going forwards, we're raising funds entirely through grants and donations from users and community pools.\n\n## Request\n\nWe request 1% of community pool funds, capped at $20,000 from a number of chains, including The Cosmos Hub, to contribute to The ICI Campaign on Spark IBC. For The Hub, this makes our total ask ~$20k or 1,438 ATOM at the time of writing.\n\nIf passed,\n\n- 50% of issued funds will be donated directly to ICI for general development, hosting and maintenance, to be used alongside other funding sources like private contributions done through the Spark platform.\n- The remaining 50% will be used as incentives for community members to create and submit content about general cosmos tech. For other chains, this 50% is reserved for content about stuff built in that chains ecosystem, but since the Hub is positioned a bit differently, we think it's match made in heaven to direct these funds towards content on things like IBC, CosmWasm, the Cosmos SDK, etc.\n- For The Hub, this amounts to ~20k USD in Atom total, which is about 1,438 ATOM, which will then be split 50/50 as outlined above.\n\nEach network that approves funding will be rewarded with Spark Points based on their full donation amount and a customized entry on our leaderboard labeled “[chain name] Community.” Spark Points are used within the Spark IBC system to recognize users for their contributions to the Interchain. In this case, there would be an entry made for “The Cosmos Hub Community” with 20k Spark Points.\n\nOne Spark Point is representative of one dollar (or USDC, or, in this case, token equivalent) donated, and is tracked through the soulbound $SPARK token on Juno Network. For these donations, Spark IBC will set up a wallet on Juno, or use the Bech32 converted version of the community pools address on Juno, label it accordingly on our leaderboard, and mint $SPARK equivalent to the USD value of the donated amount into it, measured by the price at the time of distribution. Slippage and fees for conversion will not be taken into account, as that's beyond the communities control.\n\nOne significant benefit of multi-chain projects is the unique ability to distribute our funding requests across different sources to minimize sell pressure and the burden on any single community pool/token. This sort of effort is something that Spark IBC plans to pioneer and offer as a potential service to any who use the Spark IBC platform for fundraising in future.\n\n\nSimilar funding requests will also be submitted to the following Cosmos chains:\n\n- Agoric\n- Akash\n- Band\n- Carbon\n- Cheqd\n- Chihuahua\n- Comdex\n- Cosmos Hub\n- Evmos\n- Fetch AI\n- Injective\n- Juno\n- Kava\n- Kujira\n- Osmosis\n- Persistence\n- Secret\n- Sommelier\n- Stargaze\n- Teritori\n- LUNC\n- Terra\n\n[Funding Ask Amounts Spreadsheet](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/cosmos1/optimized/2X/e/edd7c2b885e321d82eefd114a7be03f232534462_2_629x500.png)\n\n## Spending Details\n\n### Base Contribution\n\nIn addition to the ICI info on SparkIBC.zone, we also have a rough breakdown of how funds will be spent given hitting certain funding tiers, found here 2\nLink: [ICI Budget Outline for Initial Raise](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13GYFnJYozptojj3ytE_OYbo03inoQ1dEJxnHnmparWQ/edit#gid=0)\n\n### Incentives Program\n\nAs stated, 50% of the requested $20k will be used exclusively to incentivize content related to general Cosmos tech \u0026 terminology on the Index and Resource hub. This allows community members and content creators the ability to earn a little income while contributing something beneficial to the entire interchain. It also ensures that a portion of the allotted funding amount returns to the community in a very direct way.\n\nNote: the Spark \u0026 ICI Team reserve the right to deny payment, both pre/post-production, to anyone on the basis of content quality or attempts to manipulate this proposed system (i.e. needlessly long articles, videos, copy others existing work as a full new submission etc.); this is not a “trustless” incentive program. At this time, we will only accept English submissions meeting basic literary standards; however, we may expand this program to include other languages in the future and/or add a translation tier to the list of incentives below (we are open to feedback on these details):\n\n[Submission outline](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/cosmos1/optimized/2X/9/92c9a4e08b05afbc1cf46e0da69df8b0c827f1ee_2_450x500.png)\n\n*$0.05/word (written content) and $5.00/min. (video content) are below industry standards, but the crux of this project is to further incentivize creators who are already producing original content, while refining and updating existing material that needs to constantly be updated. In its entirety, this project will both promote new material and provide house-keeping for fresh, up-to-date information in order to attract new ecosystem investors and users.\n\n## Misc. Details\n\nHow will payment be distributed and handled?\n\n- We will be asking for the requested amount as a single lump sum payment. The amount granted will then be split into two chunks, each comprising 50% of the total.\n\t- 50% will be DCA'd out into stables over the following 15 days. Meaning a maximum daily sell pressure of no more than ~$666 per day for chains granting the full 20k, such as the Hub, and far less for others. This will be the base contribution.\n\t- The other 50% will be set aside for the content incentives program outlined above, and we will be gauging community sentiment on doing one of the three following options\n\t\t- Keep in the native currency\n\t\t- DCA out to stables along with the rest. Sell pressure will be kept to the above figure or less.\n\t\t- DCA out half (of the 50%, or 25% of the total) along with the base contribution.\n\nWill the incentives program be transparent?\n\t- Of course! We will keep records of payouts and the work done to receive them for the community to review.

At Spark IBC, we believe that, currently, “Cosmos” and the greater Interchain are extremely fragmented, as communities, educational resources, NFT collections, Dapps and tools each reside in their own remote corners of the ecosystem.\n\nICI aims to change this by taking the first step toward building the unified, multi-chain future that the community has been waiting for, and that we believe is paramount to Cosmos gaining mass adoption in the next market cycle. We are currently running an ICI funding campaign on the Spark IBC platform, found here, [https://sparkibc.zone](https://sparkibc.zone) 4 along with more details about ICI itself.\n\nWe are avoiding VCs and private investors in this endeavor, because ICI is only a valuable resource if it remains unbiased and beholden to no one but the community that uses it. Therefore, all ICI costs so far have come out of our own pockets, and going forwards, we're raising funds entirely through grants and donations from users and community pools.\n\n## Request\n\nWe request 1% of community pool funds, capped at $20,000 from a number of chains, including The Cosmos Hub, to contribute to The ICI Campaign on Spark IBC. For The Hub, this makes our total ask ~$20k or 1,438 ATOM at the time of writing.\n\nIf passed,\n\n- 50% of issued funds will be donated directly to ICI for general development, hosting and maintenance, to be used alongside other funding sources like private contributions done through the Spark platform.\n- The remaining 50% will be used as incentives for community members to create and submit content about general cosmos tech. For other chains, this 50% is reserved for content about stuff built in that chains ecosystem, but since the Hub is positioned a bit differently, we think it's match made in heaven to direct these funds towards content on things like IBC, CosmWasm, the Cosmos SDK, etc.\n- For The Hub, this amounts to ~20k USD in Atom total, which is about 1,438 ATOM, which will then be split 50/50 as outlined above.\n\nEach network that approves funding will be rewarded with Spark Points based on their full donation amount and a customized entry on our leaderboard labeled “[chain name] Community.” Spark Points are used within the Spark IBC system to recognize users for their contributions to the Interchain. In this case, there would be an entry made for “The Cosmos Hub Community” with 20k Spark Points.\n\nOne Spark Point is representative of one dollar (or USDC, or, in this case, token equivalent) donated, and is tracked through the soulbound $SPARK token on Juno Network. For these donations, Spark IBC will set up a wallet on Juno, or use the Bech32 converted version of the community pools address on Juno, label it accordingly on our leaderboard, and mint $SPARK equivalent to the USD value of the donated amount into it, measured by the price at the time of distribution. Slippage and fees for conversion will not be taken into account, as that's beyond the communities control.\n\nOne significant benefit of multi-chain projects is the unique ability to distribute our funding requests across different sources to minimize sell pressure and the burden on any single community pool/token. This sort of effort is something that Spark IBC plans to pioneer and offer as a potential service to any who use the Spark IBC platform for fundraising in future.\n\n\nSimilar funding requests will also be submitted to the following Cosmos chains:\n\n- Agoric\n- Akash\n- Band\n- Carbon\n- Cheqd\n- Chihuahua\n- Comdex\n- Cosmos Hub\n- Evmos\n- Fetch AI\n- Injective\n- Juno\n- Kava\n- Kujira\n- Osmosis\n- Persistence\n- Secret\n- Sommelier\n- Stargaze\n- Teritori\n- LUNC\n- Terra\n\n[Funding Ask Amounts Spreadsheet](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/cosmos1/optimized/2X/e/edd7c2b885e321d82eefd114a7be03f232534462_2_629x500.png)\n\n## Spending Details\n\n### Base Contribution\n\nIn addition to the ICI info on SparkIBC.zone, we also have a rough breakdown of how funds will be spent given hitting certain funding tiers, found here 2\nLink: [ICI Budget Outline for Initial Raise](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13GYFnJYozptojj3ytE_OYbo03inoQ1dEJxnHnmparWQ/edit#gid=0)\n\n### Incentives Program\n\nAs stated, 50% of the requested $20k will be used exclusively to incentivize content related to general Cosmos tech \u0026 terminology on the Index and Resource hub. This allows community members and content creators the ability to earn a little income while contributing something beneficial to the entire interchain. It also ensures that a portion of the allotted funding amount returns to the community in a very direct way.\n\nNote: the Spark \u0026 ICI Team reserve the right to deny payment, both pre/post-production, to anyone on the basis of content quality or attempts to manipulate this proposed system (i.e. needlessly long articles, videos, copy others existing work as a full new submission etc.); this is not a “trustless” incentive program. At this time, we will only accept English submissions meeting basic literary standards; however, we may expand this program to include other languages in the future and/or add a translation tier to the list of incentives below (we are open to feedback on these details):\n\n[Submission outline](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/cosmos1/optimized/2X/9/92c9a4e08b05afbc1cf46e0da69df8b0c827f1ee_2_450x500.png)\n\n*$0.05/word (written content) and $5.00/min. (video content) are below industry standards, but the crux of this project is to further incentivize creators who are already producing original content, while refining and updating existing material that needs to constantly be updated. In its entirety, this project will both promote new material and provide house-keeping for fresh, up-to-date information in order to attract new ecosystem investors and users.\n\n## Misc. Details\n\nHow will payment be distributed and handled?\n\n- We will be asking for the requested amount as a single lump sum payment. The amount granted will then be split into two chunks, each comprising 50% of the total.\n\t- 50% will be DCA'd out into stables over the following 15 days. Meaning a maximum daily sell pressure of no more than ~$666 per day for chains granting the full 20k, such as the Hub, and far less for others. This will be the base contribution.\n\t- The other 50% will be set aside for the content incentives program outlined above, and we will be gauging community sentiment on doing one of the three following options\n\t\t- Keep in the native currency\n\t\t- DCA out to stables along with the rest. Sell pressure will be kept to the above figure or less.\n\t\t- DCA out half (of the 50%, or 25% of the total) along with the base contribution.\n\nWill the incentives program be transparent?\n\t- Of course! We will keep records of payouts and the work done to receive them for the community to review. This also serves to provide a metric for results, and should help communities gauge whether a continuation of this program later down the road would be something of interest to them or not.\n\nHow long do you intend the incentive programs to last?\n\t- Due to the drastically different ask amounts amongst various chains, as well as the amount of content relevant to them, some chains' incentives may dry up much quicker than others. We believe that with the program we've outlined above, regardless of the duration, the general amount of work achieved per dollar spent should be similar.\n\nWhat happens if a chain does not pass the proposal, are they to be treated any differently?\n\t- Absolutely not.

AiB seeks damages to be determined at trial, and asks the amount be “not less than $150,000.” \\n\\nIn our view, the lawsuit initiated by AiB constitutes a tortious act, which may result in unwarranted scrutiny and legal implications for $ATOM and the Cosmos network.  Let it be known that AiB has filed and financed a frivolous lawsuit against a community member utilizing funds given to them for the assumed propagation and development of open-source software. \\n\\nIt is our utmost concern that AiB initiated this legal action without a sound basis in a federal court lacking genuine jurisdiction, rendering the Cosmos network vulnerable to ramifications of AiB’s pleadings that declare the core technology framework to be both centralized and dominated by a founding Cosmos entity. \\n\\nIn light of this negative precedent established with AiB’s lawsuit, the objective of this proposal is to rectify the situation with a positive, restorative precedent. This proposal is designed to lend unequivocal support to Grace – for her fortitude in prioritizing the public interest in our public goods, over the limited interests of a private entity. \\n\\nAt this critical growth juncture, it is paramount that we assertively demand radical transparency from our founding organizations; however, this goal is rendered unachievable when tort systems are exploited to effect intimidation and harassment. \\n\\nWe earnestly implore the community to consider the full contents of this proposal, as its approval will signify and secure a commitment of resources needed to defend Grace and provide evidence to the American fiat courts that the Cosmos ecosystem – that our code and our culture, are truly decentralized products and experiences. \\n\\n The full text of this proposal is available via [IPFS link](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmeS7wp1mpkgLrXEosaL4d517aNKcfvzhDKdSy2XGGWjCY/QmcJtFw4xUpBuDoRNRKQeMCaZDuz7THemgWwc9Htv5Zghk)*\\n\\n**Objective:* \\n\\nBased on projected costs provided by law firms, we are requesting 50,000 ATOM to secure competent legal representation for Grace Yu. Grace will be seeking reimbursement for all legal costs and expenses from AIB.  Grace will work with Notional for any remittance/reimbursement of funds back to the Cosmos Hub community pool.\\n\\nAs of 4/5/23, AiB has communicated that in the event the Cosmos Hub passes a funding proposal for Grace’s legal defense fund, AiB “will reimburse the Cosmos community for the portion used.” \\n\\nIn the event the outcome of a settlement or a trial works in favor of the petitioner, and damages are awarded to AiB; Grace will not use any of the funds allocated to pay for damages. Funds allocated will be used strictly for her legal defense, only. \\n\\n**Arrangement:** \\n\\nIn the circumstance of successful passage of this proposal, the liquidation of ATOM will be executed in two tranches. The initial tranche will entail 25,000 ATOM which are to be converted into USDC by the undersigned parties of the multisig wallet after obtaining 2/3 authorization. Should the motion to dismiss the lawsuit prove to be unviable, this will trigger the second and concluding tranche which will liquidate the remaining 25,000 ATOM. \\n\\nIn the situation whereby AiB withdraws the lawsuit, and no legal costs and fees are awarded, the remainder of the designated legal funding, and its unspent balance will be duly restored to the hub. \\n\\n1.In the event the lawsuit settles, and Grace is awarded legal costs and fees without personal or compensatory damages, she will use those funds to reimburse the community pool in full, and will not retain any of the payment until the community pool is fully reimbursed. \\n2. In the event Grace is unable to claim reimbursement of legal fees from AiB, and should there be unused funds remaining at the conclusion of the matter, she will return the balance of the funds using MsgFundCommunityPool. \\n3. In the event Grace is awarded any personal and compensatory damages, separate from legal costs and fees, she will remit 33.33% of awarded damages (post tax) back to the hub, any reimbursement of legal costs and fees, in addition to any balance remaining from her her legal defense fund using MsgFundCommunityPool. \\n\\nNote on flow \\n\\ni. This proposal seeks 50,000 ATOM \\nii. The multisig group will transfer ATOM to Osmosis to convert ATOM to USDC. \\niii. USDC will be sent to Grace’s law firm via Bitpay transaction. \\niv. Grace’s law firm will provide a written letter to confirm receipt of funds, and that letter and redacted invoices will be uploaded to the Cosmos hub forum. Redactions are necessary to protect the attorney-client privilege, as well as Grace. \\n\\n**Transparency** \\n\\nMonthly legal invoices will be uploaded to www.dropthelawsuit.org. Narrative descriptions of work performed on the invoices will be redacted to preserve privacy, along with work-product and attorney-client privileged information. Once the matter of AiB v Grace Yu is settled, Grace will provide a report as to how the funds were spent. Providing a transparency report during the course of litigation would compromise the discretion her legal team requires to execute on tactical objectives and could waive the attorney-client privilege. \\n\\n**Why We Need to Fund #FreeGrace #dropthelawsuit:** \\n\\n* Cosmos is an assemblage of software components that operate under the open source model.\\n* Compliance with regulatory requirements necessitates the decentralization of Cosmos code. \\n* Open-source developers are afforded the privilege of seamlessly migrating their work alone or under the auspices and sponsorship of different organizations; hence, any practice that opposes open-source tenets, such as the AiB modus operandi, is not only contrary to established open-source norms but also undermines the fostering of an innovative culture that is indispensable for the competitive propagation of software code. \\n* Multilateral contributions to open source software frameworks is perceived as an indicator of maturity and resilience.  An increase in diverse contributions to open-source software amplifies its reach, thereby guaranteeing a more thorough review process.

AiB seeks damages to be determined at trial, and asks the amount be “not less than $150,000.” \\n\\nIn our view, the lawsuit initiated by AiB constitutes a tortious act, which may result in unwarranted scrutiny and legal implications for $ATOM and the Cosmos network.  Let it be known that AiB has filed and financed a frivolous lawsuit against a community member utilizing funds given to them for the assumed propagation and development of open-source software. \\n\\nIt is our utmost concern that AiB initiated this legal action without a sound basis in a federal court lacking genuine jurisdiction, rendering the Cosmos network vulnerable to ramifications of AiB’s pleadings that declare the core technology framework to be both centralized and dominated by a founding Cosmos entity. \\n\\nIn light of this negative precedent established with AiB’s lawsuit, the objective of this proposal is to rectify the situation with a positive, restorative precedent. This proposal is designed to lend unequivocal support to Grace – for her fortitude in prioritizing the public interest in our public goods, over the limited interests of a private entity. \\n\\nAt this critical growth juncture, it is paramount that we assertively demand radical transparency from our founding organizations; however, this goal is rendered unachievable when tort systems are exploited to effect intimidation and harassment. \\n\\nWe earnestly implore the community to consider the full contents of this proposal, as its approval will signify and secure a commitment of resources needed to defend Grace and provide evidence to the American fiat courts that the Cosmos ecosystem – that our code and our culture, are truly decentralized products and experiences. \\n\\n The full text of this proposal is available via [IPFS link](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmeS7wp1mpkgLrXEosaL4d517aNKcfvzhDKdSy2XGGWjCY/QmcJtFw4xUpBuDoRNRKQeMCaZDuz7THemgWwc9Htv5Zghk)*\\n\\n**Objective:* \\n\\nBased on projected costs provided by law firms, we are requesting 50,000 ATOM to secure competent legal representation for Grace Yu. Grace will be seeking reimbursement for all legal costs and expenses from AIB.  Grace will work with Notional for any remittance/reimbursement of funds back to the Cosmos Hub community pool.\\n\\nAs of 4/5/23, AiB has communicated that in the event the Cosmos Hub passes a funding proposal for Grace’s legal defense fund, AiB “will reimburse the Cosmos community for the portion used.” \\n\\nIn the event the outcome of a settlement or a trial works in favor of the petitioner, and damages are awarded to AiB; Grace will not use any of the funds allocated to pay for damages. Funds allocated will be used strictly for her legal defense, only. \\n\\n**Arrangement:** \\n\\nIn the circumstance of successful passage of this proposal, the liquidation of ATOM will be executed in two tranches. The initial tranche will entail 25,000 ATOM which are to be converted into USDC by the undersigned parties of the multisig wallet after obtaining 2/3 authorization. Should the motion to dismiss the lawsuit prove to be unviable, this will trigger the second and concluding tranche which will liquidate the remaining 25,000 ATOM. \\n\\nIn the situation whereby AiB withdraws the lawsuit, and no legal costs and fees are awarded, the remainder of the designated legal funding, and its unspent balance will be duly restored to the hub. \\n\\n1.In the event the lawsuit settles, and Grace is awarded legal costs and fees without personal or compensatory damages, she will use those funds to reimburse the community pool in full, and will not retain any of the payment until the community pool is fully reimbursed. \\n2. In the event Grace is unable to claim reimbursement of legal fees from AiB, and should there be unused funds remaining at the conclusion of the matter, she will return the balance of the funds using MsgFundCommunityPool. \\n3. In the event Grace is awarded any personal and compensatory damages, separate from legal costs and fees, she will remit 33.33% of awarded damages (post tax) back to the hub, any reimbursement of legal costs and fees, in addition to any balance remaining from her her legal defense fund using MsgFundCommunityPool. \\n\\nNote on flow \\n\\ni. This proposal seeks 50,000 ATOM \\nii. The multisig group will transfer ATOM to Osmosis to convert ATOM to USDC. \\niii. USDC will be sent to Grace’s law firm via Bitpay transaction. \\niv. Grace’s law firm will provide a written letter to confirm receipt of funds, and that letter and redacted invoices will be uploaded to the Cosmos hub forum. Redactions are necessary to protect the attorney-client privilege, as well as Grace. \\n\\n**Transparency** \\n\\nMonthly legal invoices will be uploaded to www.dropthelawsuit.org. Narrative descriptions of work performed on the invoices will be redacted to preserve privacy, along with work-product and attorney-client privileged information. Once the matter of AiB v Grace Yu is settled, Grace will provide a report as to how the funds were spent. Providing a transparency report during the course of litigation would compromise the discretion her legal team requires to execute on tactical objectives and could waive the attorney-client privilege. \\n\\n**Why We Need to Fund #FreeGrace #dropthelawsuit:** \\n\\n* Cosmos is an assemblage of software components that operate under the open source model.\\n* Compliance with regulatory requirements necessitates the decentralization of Cosmos code. \\n* Open-source developers are afforded the privilege of seamlessly migrating their work alone or under the auspices and sponsorship of different organizations; hence, any practice that opposes open-source tenets, such as the AiB modus operandi, is not only contrary to established open-source norms but also undermines the fostering of an innovative culture that is indispensable for the competitive propagation of software code. \\n* Multilateral contributions to open source software frameworks is perceived as an indicator of maturity and resilience.  An increase in diverse contributions to open-source software amplifies its reach, thereby guaranteeing a more thorough review process. This is in line with the well-known adage that “more eyes make for fewer bugs.”  \\n* Due to Grace’s advocacy, a former Tendermint and Ignite contributor, Denis Fadeev is now free to engage in activities of his choosing – including the ability to continue work on the project he created independent of AiB. This outcome is attributable to Denis’ persistence, supported by the efforts of the #FreeDenis community facilitated by Grace Yu. \\n* While we recognize that the values of the Cosmos may not appear coherent at first glance, there is a fundamental alignment that we all share. This alignment, is the inalienable right to freedom of speech, and the freedom of expression. \\n* Protecting these freedoms are necessary to evince an alternative decentralized financial system dependent on radical transparency, accountability, open-source, and decentralization for legitimacy and resilience. \\n* The Cosmos Hub will be exercising its sovereign authority to protect a community member from a founding organization in a manner that is both unprecedented and essential to preserving the values vital to the Cosmos vision. \\n* The Cosmos Hub would indirectly assert itself in a matter being adjudicated in a fiat court, in the prestigious Eastern District of New York. \\n\\n**Multisig Address**\\ncosmos17p0ssxp4dwnr4qvs7kgm4currxfmaatkh4gcl3 \\n\\n**Signers:** \\n\\nGreg Osuri, Akash \\nMike Purvis, Croncat \\nJohn Macleod, ConsensusOne Validator \\n\\n***Note**\\n\\nThis proposal represents the opinions of the draftees and is based upon draftees’ understanding of the events, and or, in addition to the understanding that has been set forth in the lawsuit.

However, there is a prevailing sentiment of unity surrounding the ongoing legal dispute between All in Bits, Inc., and Grace Yu. We are collectively advocating for All in Bits, Inc. to withdraw their lawsuit against Grace Yu, as it threatens not only the reputation of our network but also the values that underpin the Cosmos vision.\n\n### Context and Background:\nAll in Bits, Inc., a foundation organisation of $ATOM, has initiated a lawsuit against Grace Yu, a member of our community, on grounds that many believe to be unsubstantiated. The case was taken to a Federal court, seeking damages of $150,000. The legal costs incurred just to initiate the case substantially exceed this value. The concern is that this legal action seems motivated by vindictive intent rather than legitimate legal grievances, which has led to widespread confusion and increasing distrust.\n\n### Legal Implications and Community Impact:\nThe lawsuit against Grace Yu has the potential to instigate unwarranted scrutiny and may have legal implications for $ATOM. The impact of this legal action on the token's value, precedent,, and overall community sentiment should be carefully considered. Moreover, the community's perception of All in Bits, Inc., may suffer, which could weaken our collective trust in the Cosmos network.\n\n### Misuse of Funds and Core Values:\nWe find it particularly concerning that All in Bits, Inc., has chosen to allocate funds, initially intended for the development and promotion of open-source software, towards financing this lawsuit. This decision contradicts the principles of transparency and fairness that are fundamental to our community.\n\n### Request:\nWe disapprove of legal action against any community member from founding organisations. Respectfully, for the benefit of the ecosystem, we ask that All in Bits, Inc. drop its lawsuit against Grace Yu, immediately.\n\n\nVoting options\n1.

However, there is a prevailing sentiment of unity surrounding the ongoing legal dispute between All in Bits, Inc., and Grace Yu. We are collectively advocating for All in Bits, Inc. to withdraw their lawsuit against Grace Yu, as it threatens not only the reputation of our network but also the values that underpin the Cosmos vision.\n\n### Context and Background:\nAll in Bits, Inc., a foundation organisation of $ATOM, has initiated a lawsuit against Grace Yu, a member of our community, on grounds that many believe to be unsubstantiated. The case was taken to a Federal court, seeking damages of $150,000. The legal costs incurred just to initiate the case substantially exceed this value. The concern is that this legal action seems motivated by vindictive intent rather than legitimate legal grievances, which has led to widespread confusion and increasing distrust.\n\n### Legal Implications and Community Impact:\nThe lawsuit against Grace Yu has the potential to instigate unwarranted scrutiny and may have legal implications for $ATOM. The impact of this legal action on the token's value, precedent,, and overall community sentiment should be carefully considered. Moreover, the community's perception of All in Bits, Inc., may suffer, which could weaken our collective trust in the Cosmos network.\n\n### Misuse of Funds and Core Values:\nWe find it particularly concerning that All in Bits, Inc., has chosen to allocate funds, initially intended for the development and promotion of open-source software, towards financing this lawsuit. This decision contradicts the principles of transparency and fairness that are fundamental to our community.\n\n### Request:\nWe disapprove of legal action against any community member from founding organisations. Respectfully, for the benefit of the ecosystem, we ask that All in Bits, Inc. drop its lawsuit against Grace Yu, immediately.\n\n\nVoting options\n1. Yes: Approval of the proposal in its current form.\n2. No: Disapproval of the proposal in its current form.\n3.
