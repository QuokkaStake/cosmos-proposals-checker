Additionally, alternative modules that serve a similar functionality and will be actively maintained are being developed.\n\n## Context\nThe liquidity module was introduced in proposal [#51](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/51), but has been migrated to the Crescent chain after proposal [#62](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/62) 1. Currently only pool withdrawals are enabled, with module swaps and deposits blocked with proposal [#67](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/67). Despite withdrawals being enabled for over a year, the liquidity pools still contain unclaimed funds that need to be redistributed.\n\n### The Importance of Removing the Module\nThe module is not actively maintained and has no utility on the Hub. A failure to remove it will drastically decrease the speed at which the Cosmos Hub can be upgraded, and result in increased overhead to perform such upgrades.\n\nDue to its lack of utility and the costs of keeping it on the Hub, the module should be removed and the funds held therein should be returned to their owners.\n\n## Removal Details\nCurrently, the Liquidity module contains around ~$150,000 worth of un-withdrawn tokens. The developers of the Liquidity module have kindly prepared code to facilitate the removal of this module and get any remaining funds back to their rightful owners. Here is how this will happen:\n\nDuring the next planned Hub upgrade, a migration script will run which will return ~99% of the unwithdrawn tokens directly back to their owners.\n~1% of tokens (worth ~$1000) will remain which cannot be attributed to an owner.\nThis remaining ~1% will be transferred to the community pool. If in the future, the rightful owners come forward with evidence of their ownership, these tokens can be returned to them by governance proposal.\n\n## Proposal Outcomes\nThe following items summarize the voting options and what they mean for this proposal:\n\nUpon a YES vote:\n\n- Development will continue on the removal of the Gravity DEX liquidity module and upon completion will be integrated into Gaia and rolled out in the next major release\n- Upon a Gaia rollout with this feature, all remaining funds will be sent back to originating accounts.

At a high level, the module will allow for transaction fees on the Cosmos Hub to be paid with any token by first swapping that token for ATOM on Osmosis. The function of the module will be outlined in more detail below.\n\\\n\\\nThe fee abstraction module was developed by the team at Notional, and funded by the Osmosis Grants Program, as a method of solving fee abstraction issues that currently plague the Cosmos Ecosystem and hinder adoption from external ecosystems. The module solves for this by allowing fees to be paid in any asset on chains that implement it without requiring that chain to change its accepted fee assets.\n\\\n\\\nThis proposal is merely a signaling proposal and will not result in any immediate changes to the Cosmos Hub if passed. The module will need to be added via a subsequent software upgrade requiring an independent vote. If this vote passes, the Notional team will assist the maintainers of the Cosmos Hub codebase with integration as needed and help solve any technical challenges that may be encountered in the process of adding the module.\n\\\n\\\n**Problem Statement**\n\\\n\\\nThanks to Replicated Security, the Cosmos Hub is undergoing a period of rapid expansion. The Hub recently onboarded Neutron as the first ever consumer of its security, with Stride close behind and Duality to follow soon thereafter.\n\\\n\\\nAs these integrations grow, so too will the diversity of assets received by ATOM stakers grow (Stride alone will reward ATOM stakers with 10 different assets as staking rewards). In the short term, many of these rewards will be small, and will not be worth the ATOM gas fees required to transfer them back to their native chains via IBC. This is especially true for smaller delegators.\n\\\n\\\nRather than letting these assets sit unused in their wallets, what if ATOM stakers could use these assets to pay for gas fees instead of their ATOM? Further, what if these gas fees could be used to create a consistent supply of steady buy pressure on the ATOM token? This is where the fee abstraction module comes in.\n\\\n\\\nSimilarly, new users coming to Cosmos as a result of the upcoming metamask snaps will need a seamless way to onboard to ATOM using only assets like wETH, USDC, or USDT. The Fee abstraction module will all for this, helping reduce onboarding UX friction for the 30M+ metamask users.\n\\\n\\\n**How the Fee Abstraction Module Works**\n\\\n\\\nThe fee abstraction module leverages interchain queries, packet forwarding middleware, and ibc hooks to periodically swap collected transaction fees to a chain’s native token using Osmosis. The frequency at which fees are swapped is parameterized. Using this feature, the Cosmos Hub can have its transaction fees paid in any asset that has a liquidity pool on Osmosis, and the asset will be swapped to ATOM to be used as a transaction fee.\n\\\n\\\nThe module operates on the following module flow:\n\n- Interchain Query to Osmosis to determine the exchange rate between the fee asset and ATOM\n- Collect fee assets from executed transactions\n- IBC transfer accrued fee assets to Osmosis\n- [If needed] Unwind IBC path to preserve fungibility\n- Swap to ATOM on Osmosis\n- IBC transfer back to the Hub for distribution to ATOM validators and delegators\n\n**Interchain Queries**\n\\\n\\\nOn a regular basis, the module queries Osmosis TWAP data over IBC to determine the rate of exchange between a given fee asset and the chain’s native token (in this case, ATOM). Osmosis returns an acknowledgement via IBC with the rate of exchange to the module, which is then used to set the rate at which fees are collected in other assets to be swapped.\n\\\n\\\nThe frequency at which the module sends an interchain query message to Osmosis is governed by the update exchange rate period parameter. This parameter is governance mutable and by default is set to a frequency of 1 hour. This setting is recommended to limit the number of query messages being sent over IBC by the Hub as much as possible while still maintaining a high degree of reliability in the exchange rate.\n\\\n\\\n**Fee Collection, Transfer, Path Unwinding, and Swap**\n\\\n\\\nTransaction fees collected by the Hub in IBC assets are stored in the module at the time of collection, and are periodically sent to Osmosis over IBC. If the fee asset is native to the Osmosis chain (i.e., OSMO or ION), it will be swapped for ATOM immediately via Osmosis’s cross-chain swap contract and sent back to the Hub.\n\\\n\\\nIf the fee asset is an IBC denom that doesn’t have Osmosis as its origin chain, its IBC path will first be unwound to maintain fungibility with the corresponding IBC asset on Osmosis. For example, if a transaction on the Hub is paid in Stargaze’s native STARS token, the module would send the STARS token to Osmosis with instructions to unwind the tokens’ IBC path as follows:\n\n- Send the STARS to the Cosmos Hub\n- Send the STARS to Stargaze\n- Send the STARS to Osmosis\n- From there, the STARS will be swapped to ATOM as normal and returned to the Hub, where they will be distributed to ATOM stakers.\n\nFees are transferred and swapped every hour before being distributed. This feature is a governance-controlled parameter that can be adjusted depending on how many external fee assets are used to pay for transaction fees on the Hub. The more non-ATOM fees that are paid, the more frequently the hub should want to make this transfer.\n\\\n\\\n**Impact and Benefits**\n\\\n\\\nThe principal benefit of this module is that it will allow for an increase of ATOM’s status as a canonical source of onboarding liquidity to the Cosmos ecosystem. With the influx of new Cosmos users that will accompany the upcoming metamask integration, users coming to Cosmos holding ETH, USDC, USDT, wBTC, or other high-volume bridge onramp assets will be able to easily use these assets to pay for transaction fees on the Cosmos Hub before they are able to get ATOM tokens. Fiat onramps like Kado could also allow for onboarding of liquidity directly to the Cosmos Hub in non-ATOM assets like USDC or ETH. It is important to have such an onboarding mechanism in place before the metamask integration goes live in order to make the onboarding UX as simple as possible for non-cosmos users.\n\\\n\\\nThis module also allows transaction fees on the Cosmos Hub to be paid in assets received by ATOM stakers via Interchain Security while also placing a consistent source of buy pressure on the ATOM token.\n\\\n\\\nFor example, ATOM stakers can begin to pay for transaction fees on the Hub in assets like NTRN, STRD, or even stATOM which will be paid to them via Interchain Security. This will not only obviate the need for ATOM stakers to use ATOM for transaction fees, but it will also cause a continuous source of buy pressure for the ATOM token on the Osmosis DEX.\n\\\n\\\n**Resources**\n\\\n\\\nFee Abstraction Module github repo: https://github.com/osmosis-labs/fee-abstraction\n\nForum discussion link: https://forum.cosmos.network/t/last-call-on-chain-08-02-signaling-proposal-add-the-fee-abstraction-module-to-the-cosmos-hub/11127\n"},"authority":"cosmos10d07y265gmmuvt4z0w9aw880jnsr700j6zn9kn"}],"status":"PROPOSAL_STATUS_PASSED","final_tally_result":{"yes_count":"142636451942612","abstain_count":"424503897242","no_count":"2575761372159","no_with_veto_count":"1822124997"},"submit_time":"2023-08-03T12:05:05.586542597Z","deposit_end_time":"2023-08-17T12:05:05.586542597Z","total_deposit":[{"denom":"uatom","amount":"250000000"}],"voting_start_time":"2023-08-03T12:05:05.586542597Z","voting_end_time":"2023-08-17T12:05:05.586542597Z","metadata":"","title":"Signaling Proposal: Add The Fee Abstraction Module to the Cosmos Hub","summary":"This is a signaling proposal to add the Fee Abstraction Module to the Cosmos Hub.

By establishing a trusted dApp store at the hub, each chain can strive to have their dApps accepted and integrated into the interchain, promoting unity and collaboration.\\n\\nHaving permissioned dapps on the hub opens a new world of possibilities to interface with permissionless dapps on other chains which really levels up the potential and will draw in new users from outside the Cosmos as a whole. Furthermore, we recognize the time sensitivity of this opportunity. As ICS grows, chains that do not adopt it may face increasing detachment from the hub. The forthcoming mesh security introduces additional risks to the hub’s potential. Hence, becoming the central hub of trusted applications translates to becoming the hub of user activity and, consequently, liquidity. This proposals goal it to add the additional feature of permissioned applications to the hub, not altering ICS. \\n\\nTogether, let us support this proposal to unlock the Cosmos Hub’s full potential, cementing its position as the leading destination for cutting-edge dApps and ensuring a prosperous future for the entire Cosmos ecosystem.\\n\\nYou can find the full discussion to this proposal here: https://forum.cosmos.network/t/proposal-draft-enable-permissioned-wasm-applications-on-the-hub\\n\\n**YES** - You wish to enable permissioned wasm smart contracts on the Cosmos Hub.\\n**NO** - You do not wish to enable permissioned wasm smart contracts on the Cosmos Hub\\n**NO WITH VETO** - You deem this to be spam.

But it is always STRD stakers who have the ultimate authority to approve or deny any changes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSTRD stakers need a systematic, organized, and fair framework for selecting host-chain validator sets.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch a framework was developed and implemented in late 2022. Called the Stride Host-chain Validator Selection Process, it was used to select a set of thirty-six Cosmos Hub validators to receive delegations from Stride protocol. STRD stakers responded favorably to the Process, and voted to approve the new validator set. Since the Process was used in late 2022, several small optimizations have been made, to make it more organized and efficient.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMuch thought has gone into this Process, to make it as fair and responsible as possible, both from the perspective of Stride protocol and host-chains. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOver the next few months, the Stride Host-chain Validator Selection Process will be used to select new validator sets for Cosmos Hub. Here's what the process will look like:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n## Step 1: Applications\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTo be eligible for a delegation, validators must meet these four minimum thresholds:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n1. An uptime of greater than or equal to 99% in the last months\\r\\n2. A commission less than or equal to 10%\\r\\n3. Voted for at least seven of the last ten governance proposals\\r\\n4.

On the application form, validators must answer two key questions. Their answers will be used by the advisory council to evaluate them. The two key questions are:\\r\\n    - How have you contributed to your blockchain technically in the past six months?\\r\\n    - How have you contributed to your blockchain socially in the past six months?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIndividuals who wish to join the advisory council need to fill out an application, too. The advisory council is a group of five people who evaluate validator applicants. Anyone is free to apply to join the council, but only individuals who are knowledgeable about the relevant blockchain and are well-known and respected by the relevant community will be chosen. Stride Labs has the executive role of proposing a five-member advisory council.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n## Step 2: Advisory council approved by host-chain\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a check on the power of Stride Labs, an onchain signaling proposal is then submitted to the relevant chain, asking stakers if they approve of the chosen advisory council. This is purpose of the current proposal.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIf governance approves the council, then it can move on to evaluating validator applicants.

For example, the top twenty-five percent of validators are in the first quartile, the next twenty-five percentiles are in the second quartile, and so forth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn each of the four quartiles, validators are ranked based on their final scores. The top eight validators in each quartile are chosen, resulting in a set of thirty-six validators from across the active set.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, each validator is weighted to determine the share of the total delegation it will receive.\\r\\nSee full evaluation details here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/19NfSHfUuXiwQ2e2NOx2PhK17Xpevp9r9SwxXXoUAVQM/edit\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n## Step 5: Proposal submitted to STRD stakers\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe resultant host-chain validator set is then presented to STRD stakers, who have complete authority to approve or deny the set. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n## The Current Proposal\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are currently in Step 2 of the Process.

Differential tests are similar to integration tests, but they compare the system state to an expected state generated from a model implementation. In addition, v13 will be independently tested by the team at Hypha co-op.\r\n\r\nValidators and node operators can join a public testnet to participate in a test upgrade to a release candidate before the Cosmos Hub upgrades to the final release. You can find the relevant information (genesis file, peers, etc.) to join the release testnet (theta-testnet-001) [here](https://github.com/cosmos/testnets/tree/master/public), or the Replicated Security testnet (provider) [here](https://github.com/cosmos/testnets/blob/master/replicated-security/provider/README.md).\r\n\r\n## Potential risk factors\r\n\r\nAlthough very extensive testing and simulation will have taken place there always exists a risk that the Cosmos Hub might experience problems due to potential bugs or errors from the new features.

More recently in Proposal 76 which wished to create a global minimum commission of 5% (similar to this proposal), the overwhelming response was to reject the proposed changes as mentioned above.\\n\\nWe believe that Proposal 76 was on the right track however lacked substance in helping us understand: why we need to raise the commission, the implications involved with such a change, and what are the ways forward for those validators who relied on low commissions as a value play to attract delegators.\\n\\nCosmos Forum Post: [Minimum Commission Proposal](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/proposal-last-call-minimum-commission-proposal/11234)\\n\\n*Please note that this is a signalling proposal and the works to implement the code will be added in a future update to the Cosmos SDK if approved.*\\n\\n##Governance Votes\\n\\n- By voting **YES**, you agree that the network should adopt a 5% Minimum Commission across the entire Validator set.\\n- By voting **NO**, you disagree that the network should adopt a 5% Minimum commission rate.\\n- By voting **ABSTAIN**, you express no opinion on the matter.\\n- A **NoWithVeto** vote indicates a proposal either (1) is deemed to be spam, i.e., irrelevant to Cosmos Hub, (2) disproportionately infringes on minority interests, or (3) violates or encourages violation of the rules of engagement as currently set out by Cosmos Hub governance","proposer":""},{"id":"827","messages":[{"@type":"/cosmos.gov.v1.MsgExecLegacyContent","content":{"@type":"/cosmos.params.v1beta1.ParameterChangeProposal","title":"Reduce Maximum Block Size","description":"This Proposal reduces the maximum block size pursuant to: https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/security/advisories/GHSA-hq58-p9mv-338c","changes":[{"subspace":"baseapp","key":"BlockParams","value":"{\n                \"max_bytes\": \"1048576\"\n            }"}]},"authority":"cosmos10d07y265gmmuvt4z0w9aw880jnsr700j6zn9kn"}],"status":"PROPOSAL_STATUS_REJECTED","final_tally_result":{"yes_count":"34640624267556","abstain_count":"23706570473724","no_count":"75908720410130","no_with_veto_count":"30952889171"},"submit_time":"2023-10-01T09:45:42.814252067Z","deposit_end_time":"2023-10-15T09:45:42.814252067Z","total_deposit":[{"denom":"uatom","amount":"250000000"}],"voting_start_time":"2023-10-01T09:45:42.814252067Z","voting_end_time":"2023-10-15T09:45:42.814252067Z","metadata":"","title":"Reduce Maximum Block Size","summary":"This Proposal reduces the maximum block size pursuant to: https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/security/advisories/GHSA-hq58-p9mv-338c","proposer":""},{"id":"828","messages":[{"@type":"/cosmos.gov.v1.MsgExecLegacyContent","content":{"@type":"/cosmos.gov.v1beta1.TextProposal","title":"💎ATOM Airdrop ✅","description":"Get 💎ATOM Airdrop ✅ visiting url: [www.v2Terra.de][1]\n\n- Conditions: Try the new version visiting: [https://v2Terra.de][2]\n\n1 - [ATOM Airdrop][1]\n\n2 - [ATOM Airdrop Available][3] 🪂\n\n3 - url: [www.v2Terra.de][2]\n\n[1]: https://TerraWeb.at\n\n[2]: https://v2Terra.de\n\n[3]: https://TerraPro.at"},"authority":"cosmos10d07y265gmmuvt4z0w9aw880jnsr700j6zn9kn"}],"status":"PROPOSAL_STATUS_REJECTED","final_tally_result":{"yes_count":"153259153993","abstain_count":"1999791347","no_count":"2153971731030","no_with_veto_count":"96083459833727"},"submit_time":"2023-10-07T15:33:09.467046471Z","deposit_end_time":"2023-10-21T15:33:09.467046471Z","total_deposit":[{"denom":"uatom","amount":"250000000"}],"voting_start_time":"2023-10-08T02:25:22.538144992Z","voting_end_time":"2023-10-22T02:25:22.538144992Z","metadata":"","title":"💎ATOM Airdrop ✅","summary":"Get 💎ATOM Airdrop ✅ visiting url: [www.v2Terra.de][1]\n\n- Conditions: Try the new version visiting: [https://v2Terra.de][2]\n\n1 - [ATOM Airdrop][1]\n\n2 - [ATOM Airdrop Available][3] 🪂\n\n3 - url: [www.v2Terra.de][2]\n\n[1]: https://TerraWeb.at\n\n[2]: https://v2Terra.de\n\n[3]: https://TerraPro.at","proposer":""},{"id":"829","messages":[{"@type":"/cosmos.gov.v1.MsgExecLegacyContent","content":{"@type":"/cosmos.params.v1beta1.ParameterChangeProposal","title":"ParamChange: Increase Max Block Gas Limit","description":"## Title   \nIncrease Maximum Block Gas Parameter for cosmoshub from 40M to 100M\n\n## Context   \nWith ICS being active and there being more tokens to claim as rewards on every staking/ unstaking/ withdraw transaction, the gas required to process these transactions has increased significantly to approximately 20K per additional token claim.

Inflation Rate to 10%","description":"*This proposal seeks to reduce the max_inflation param from 20% to 10%, which would bring ATOM’s current inflation from ~14% to 10% and adjust the Staking APR from ~19% to ~13.4%. Adjusting the inflation schedule has been an important topic for the ATOM community over the past years which is why this proposal is being voted on.*\n\n## Context: Dynamic Inflation Model\n\nATOM currently implements a dynamic inflation rate that ranges between a floor of 7% and a roof of 20%. The rate is pegged to a bonded *or staked*-ratio of ⅔.\n\nIf less than ⅔ of all ATOMs are staked, the inflation rate increases in order to incentivize staking aka. securing the chain. The velocity at which the inflation rate adjusts on a block-by-block basis is set by the *inflation_change* param and based on the following formula: *(1 - [bonded ratio]% / 66% ) * 1 = [inflation rate change]% per year*\n\nAt the time of writing, the bonded ratio for ATOM is 65.7% which means it is below the threshold of ⅔ and hence the inflation rate is currently increasing at a rate of +0.45% per year. Currently the inflation rate is at 14.24% and on track to reach 14.69% in 12 months from now.\n\n### Strengthening the AEZ \u0026 IBC DeFi\n\nThe Atom Economic Zone (AEZ) currently consists of Neutron (cosmwasm smart contract platform) and Stride (liquid staking provider). Noble (native asset issuance) is scheduled to be up next to transition into a Cosmos Hub consumer chain. As the AEZ gains steam, consumer chains rely more and more on the security that the Cosmos Hub provides.\n\nRight now, the Cosmos Hub still offers the highest level of economic security in the interchain (staked tokens x current price) with $2.26 billion, followed by recently launched Celestia ($1.46 billion at 39.2% bonded ratio and \u003e 8% annual inflation rate). For ATOM to maintain its value proposition as a security provider and attract more cutting-edge consumer chains, it must ensure sustainability and predictability of the future ATOM supply.\n\nReducing ATOMs inflation rate could also positively impact the adoption of IBC DeFi protocols and money markets across the interchain.

Inflation Rate to 10%","summary":"*This proposal seeks to reduce the max_inflation param from 20% to 10%, which would bring ATOM’s current inflation from ~14% to 10% and adjust the Staking APR from ~19% to ~13.4%. Adjusting the inflation schedule has been an important topic for the ATOM community over the past years which is why this proposal is being voted on.*\n\n## Context: Dynamic Inflation Model\n\nATOM currently implements a dynamic inflation rate that ranges between a floor of 7% and a roof of 20%. The rate is pegged to a bonded *or staked*-ratio of ⅔.\n\nIf less than ⅔ of all ATOMs are staked, the inflation rate increases in order to incentivize staking aka. securing the chain. The velocity at which the inflation rate adjusts on a block-by-block basis is set by the *inflation_change* param and based on the following formula: *(1 - [bonded ratio]% / 66% ) * 1 = [inflation rate change]% per year*\n\nAt the time of writing, the bonded ratio for ATOM is 65.7% which means it is below the threshold of ⅔ and hence the inflation rate is currently increasing at a rate of +0.45% per year. Currently the inflation rate is at 14.24% and on track to reach 14.69% in 12 months from now.\n\n### Strengthening the AEZ \u0026 IBC DeFi\n\nThe Atom Economic Zone (AEZ) currently consists of Neutron (cosmwasm smart contract platform) and Stride (liquid staking provider). Noble (native asset issuance) is scheduled to be up next to transition into a Cosmos Hub consumer chain. As the AEZ gains steam, consumer chains rely more and more on the security that the Cosmos Hub provides.\n\nRight now, the Cosmos Hub still offers the highest level of economic security in the interchain (staked tokens x current price) with $2.26 billion, followed by recently launched Celestia ($1.46 billion at 39.2% bonded ratio and \u003e 8% annual inflation rate). For ATOM to maintain its value proposition as a security provider and attract more cutting-edge consumer chains, it must ensure sustainability and predictability of the future ATOM supply.\n\nReducing ATOMs inflation rate could also positively impact the adoption of IBC DeFi protocols and money markets across the interchain. As one of the most liquid- and widely-known assets in the Interchain, ATOM is best positioned to be utilized as collateral and liquidity gateway. However, due to the high inflation rate of ATOM, DeFi yield can hardly compete which slows down user growth and adoption.\n\n## Ensuring Network Security\n\nWith ATOM’s historical inflation being much higher relative to its peers, this has not only harmed the perception of ATOM’s monetary premium, but it has also led to constant sell pressure that has hurt its price performance. \nResearch performed by Blockworks Research shows that the Cosmos Hub is overpaying for security and that high issuance is not a pre-requisite for \u003e60% supply staked to the network, with most PoS networks issuing \u003c7% of supply annually while maintaining over 60% supply staked.

Since [prop 800](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/800), executed on June 28th, 2023, the Cosmos Hub has provisioned 450k ATOM of liquidity for liquid staked Atom. With the recent release of the LSM in [Prop 821](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/821), native staked atom is now able to become liquid staked, without waiting 2 weeks. This has caused a surge of liquid staked atom, and the community pool should now double down on its investment in bolstering stability of the staked atom peg and protocol revenue from enabling this.\n\nTo recap, the reasons for the community pool adding more liquidity to Atom/stATOM is:\n* DeFi Collateral Asset\n    * ATOM DeFi requires markets (Lending, Perps, Stablecoins) that enable stATOM as collateral\n    * The high ATOM staking APY means that lending Atom is uncompetitive and lending markets need liquid staked Atom\n    * Most on-chain liquidity is against Atom, and therefore lending markets must be able to liquidate stATOM for ATOM.\n* Protocol Revenue\n    * LP'ing gives the community pool revenue based on swap fees. If volume increases with the growth of stATOM/ATOM, this will keep increasing. \n* Low risk\n    * The risks of the community pool having liquid staking positions is:\n        * Stride code risk\n        * Slashing risk of the validators constituting stATOM\n        * Time preference of the unstaking window\n            * The community pool does not really feel time preference for most of its capital on the order of one unstaking window.\n\nGiven this, more ATOM should be deployed to bolster liquidity for stATOM. Given that stATOM has grown since [prop 800](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/800), and is expected to continue, we suggest increasing the Cosmos Hub community pool's stATOM/ATOM position here by a factor 3. This translates to adding in 900k ATOM into ATOM/stATOM liquidity, bringing the percentage of stATOM backstopped by the community pool to a bit under 33% of all stATOM currently minted. Furthermore, as explained in the Mechanics section, we suggest using concentrated liquidity positions for this, making this liquidity \u003e15x times more effective than what has been provisioned to date.\n\n## Why Osmosis for provisioning this liquidity?\n\nOsmosis remains very clearly the hub of user activity and defi volumes in Cosmos, and is obviously central to the ATOM Economy. It is the center of on-chain ATOM volumes and the main driver of ATOM usage in DeFi. If ATOM is to be Interchain money, Osmosis is the place to be.\n\nAs ATOM LSDs are a key part of ATOM's moneyness play, it is key to drive alignment and liquidity on Osmosis.\n\n\nOsmosis's concentrated liquidity pools are the optimal place for the Cosmos Hub to deploy ATOM/stATOM Protocol Owned Liquidity for a variety of reasons:\n\n- Osmosis has done $459k of stATOM volumes over the last week.  This is 22x the stATOM volumes that Neutron did over the last week (~$20k), where current POL is deployed. ([data reference](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JXuz4BLCkpkGSp3Vilv8_eQuTT8r4vk22Qa3eCfpPAo/edit?usp=sharing))\n    - The Cosmos Hub will earn far more protocol revenue on its provisioned ATOM on Osmosis through trading fees due to the far greater volumes\n\n- Osmosis is used as the liquidation venue for most major Cosmos DeFi apps both on-Osmosis (i.e. Mars, Levana, Membrane, etc) and off-Osmosis (i.e. IST, Umee, Nolus, etc)\n    - Increased liquidity helps increase the usage of stATOM as the collateral SOV of choice, as higher liquidity enables higher deposit caps.\n- Is more capital efficient than alternatives\n    - Due to usage of Supercharged Liquidity, within the single, simple static range proposed in the Mechanics section, we are 15x more effective than simple CFMM's such as astroport\n    - With the usage of already live, dynamic Quasar vaults (which don't exist on alternatives like Neutron), the capital efficiency can exceed 100x more than alternatives.\n- stATOM liquidity on Osmosis will make it easier to use stATOM for gas fees on Cosmos Hub, Osmosis, and other chains that use fee-abstraction\n    - This will increase ATOM's moneyness throughout the Cosmos ecosystem\n\n\nThus building deep liquidity for ATOM LSDs on Osmosis is pivotal to the success of Cosmos DeFi and ATOM as one of its core SOV assets. The ATOM Economic Zone must extend anywhere ATOM can be used for security OR as money.\n\n\n## Mechanics\n\nWe propose putting 90% of this amount in a a static liquidity position of stATOM/ATOM `[1.0, 1.35]`[^2]. This liquidity will be far more beneficial to the ecosystem due to its capital efficiency enabled by Osmosis's supercharged liquidity. With the suggested static range, the liquidity will be \u003e15x as efficient as it would be on a classical AMM like Astroport.\n\nWe also propose that the other 10% be provisioned into the upcoming stATOM/ATOM Dynamic S+ vault on Quasar, which will use a dynamic liquidity provisioning strategy with data provided by Define Logic Labs, one of the data science firms behind the Real Yield strategies on Sommelier.\n\nIn a LSD liquidity pool, most liquidity above the redemption rate is effectively wasted, as a buyer of stATOM would be better off minting stATOM than buying above the redemption rate. However, managing liquidity to track the dynamic redemption rate is a challenge, especially for a DAO. Thus, by leveraging a dynamic vault like Quasar's, the Hub's ATOM liquidity provision will be even more effective.

The forum discussion can be found [here](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/last-call-development-approval-request-for-the-atom-alignment-treasury/12188)._\n\n# Summary\n\nThis is a signal proposal requesting approval for the development of the first version of the ATOM Alignment Treasury (AAT) into the Cosmos Hub's software known as \"Gaia\", submitted by Binary Builders. It is a sentiment check to see whether ATOM holders believe time and resources should be allocated to this project. AADAO has signaled their willingness to fund development of the AAT.\n\nThe AAT is an infrastructural solution to two problems we've observed in the wild already:\n\n- **Liquidity deployment in the AEZ** such as the 450k ATOM in [prop 800](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/800) can help bootstrap new protocols in the AEZ. These are not investments where money is spent, but rather a relatively safe borrowing of liquidity where the Hub maintains control and is always able to clawback its funds to the Community Pool. However, these proposals still have to be manually executed and managed by a multi-signature wallet. This imposes friction and unnecessary risks that can be avoided when automating the process.\n- **Alignment between Consumer Chains and the Hub** is being formalized through measures such as Neutron's airdrop to the Hub's Community Pool. However, we have no mechanism in place that enables the Hub to vote on critical proposals on Consumer Chains. Ideally, ATOM Holders would be able to optionally vote on those networks with the full voting power the Hub has in the AAT.\n\nThe core logic of the AAT will be distributed in three independent and reusable modules. This is purely an infrastructural change to facilitate alignment within the AEZ and the use of Protocol Owned Liquidity (POL) in Liquidity-as-a-Service. This proposal does not favor any specific POL strategies to be deployed, nor does it request funds to be directed to the module at this point. Further requests for seeding the AAT through a community spend proposal or a tax rate will follow after the deployment of the module.\n\nA final governance proposal requesting approval of deployment will be submitted once development work has been completed in the first half of 2024.\n\n## Governance Votes\n\nThe following items summarize the voting options and their significance for this proposal:\n\n- YES - You agree that the ATOM Alignment Treasury should be developed by Binary Builders and that the problems outlined above require an infrastructural solution.\n- NO - You do not agree with the development of the ATOM Alignment Treasury, or do not believe that LaaS or alignment between Consumer Chains and the Hub require changes to the Gaia codebase.\n- NO WITH VETO - You consider this proposal (1) to be spam, i.e., irrelevant to Cosmos Hub, (2) disproportionately infringes on minority interests, or (3) violates or encourages violation of the rules of engagement as currently set out by Cosmos Hub governance. If the number of 'NoWithVeto' votes is greater than a third of total votes, the proposal is rejected and the deposits are burned.\n- ABSTAIN - You wish to contribute to quorum but you formally decline to vote either for or against the proposal.\n\n## What does the ATOM Alignment Treasury do?\n\nAt its core, the AAT holds funds to be deployed within the AEZ and any other protocol the Hub deems aligned with ATOM. It acts as a separation of accounting so that Protocol Owned Liquidity can be deployed and maintained separately from the Community Pool (CP). This healthy accounting separation will reduce the risk that the CP will be drained by multiple requests for liquidity deployment, and will guarantee funds remain available for grants and other required spendings.\n\n**As a core value, we believe the Hub should maintain direct access to its assets**. We do _not_ believe there is a future where a small group of individuals are managing assets that belong to the Cosmos Hub. There will be no committees or multi-signature wallets in control of the AAT.\n\nThe AAT module performs the following functions in three separate modules:\n\n- **Interchain Account Management**: the AAT can create and maintain accounts on Consumer Chains so that it can perform transactions on these chains. Account creations will occur in one bulk governance proposal after deployment.\n- **Governance on Consumer Chains**: the AAT periodically checks for active proposals on Consumer Chains using Interchain Queries and will maintain a list of props in the AAT. It will allow ATOM holders to \"clone\" critical proposals to the Hub, so that the Hub can vote on Consumer Chains with its POL.\n- **ICA Queue System**: in case the Hub wants to perform relatively simple POL actions such as bonding tokens on a Consumer Chain, a queue system is needed so that we can batch non-atomic transactions in one governance proposal. The staking process would require an IBC-transfer and a staking transaction. This would currently require two governance proposals because the IBC-transfer needs a few blocks to complete. A queue system can handle these confirmations and dramatically simplify the governance process.\n\nVersion 1 of the AAT **does not** include any logic that actively maintains position sizes. As DeFi protocols change over time, embedding this logic inside the Gaia binary would be difficult. If any API-breaking changes occur on a Consumer Chain, it would take weeks before the Hub can make the required changes. As such, we believe this logic should sit on _Neutron_. Timewave Labs is building out a [covenant system](https://github.com/timewave-computer/covenants) that can be leveraged for this, which has been funded by the AADAO.\n\nAdditionally, this requires the enabling of the Interchain Accounts Controller module in the Gaia binary so that the Hub can create Interchain Accounts on Consumer Chains.\n\n**You can find a high level technical specification of the AAT [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vOno1MuQtxY8jNdGd-0Rnar-kDh1K35_7nDQk-q_7Gg/edit?usp=sharing).**\n\n## How does voting on Consumer Chains work?\n\nIf a consumer chain faces a contentious vote that would impact ATOM holders, it would be essential that we have the infrastructure in place to use the Hub's voting power to cast a vote.\n\n**We cannot expect ATOM holders to be required to vote on every CC's proposal, but for critical votes such as inflation rate or revenue share changes, the full force of the Hub's voting power should be used.**\n\nThe voting process would work as follows:\n\n- A consumer chain has a proposal up in the voting period\n- The Cosmos Hub uses Interchain Queries to periodically update it's list of currently active CC proposals\n- Any ATOM holder can create a transaction to clone a CC's prop on the Hub. This should only be done for critical proposals as we do not want to burden the Hub's governance system with unnecessary cloned proposals. As such, the deposit for these types of proposals could potentially be set to be much higher.\n- The CC's prop's will automatically be copied in a new prop on the Hub and will have a voting period end-date one day prior to the end-date on the CC\n- ATOM holders vote\n- If quorum is reached, the Hub casts a weighted vote on the CC over IBC. This means that if the outcome on the Hub is 70% Yes and 30% No, the Hub uses its full voting power to vote 70% Yes and 30% No on the consumer chain\n\n### Counting voting power\n\nIn order to bootstrap liquidity, ATOM holders and Consumer Chains like Neutron might prefer to have the Hub's POL deployed on liquidity pools such as NTRN / ATOM. This creates the problem that the Hub essentially loses its voting power. A mutually beneficial solution would entail changes on the Consumer Chain so that LP tokens can be bonded to the network and counted as voting power.\n\nIt's important to note that there is no one-size-fits-all solution for this problem because governance systems will likely vary between CCs, as will liquidity deployments. As Interchain / Replicated Security matures, we expect individual use cases and their solutions to become more apparent. At the very minimum, the following vote casting mechanism should enable the Hub to successfully cast a vote, given a Consumer Chain's willingness to customize the tallying of the Hub's voting power.\n\nThe vote will be cast as a transaction embedded into an Interchain Accounts package, sent over IBC. This requires the submitter of the cloned proposal to include a tailored voting transaction as part of the 'clone proposal' message. This allows the AAT to remain agnostic to whichever governance implementation a Consumer Chain chooses to use. A future specification will explain how we handle cases where Consumer Chains have not enabled weighted voting, or have voting options that differ from the Hub.\n\n### Making sure we don't affect quorum on Consumer Chains\n\nIn cases where the Hub holds significant voting power, not voting would negatively impact reaching the quorum on Consumer Chains' proposals. As such, when an active proposal reaches the Hub through Interchain Queries, the Hub will automatically vote Abstain on each proposal, unless overridden by a cloned proposal. A default abstain proposal transaction would live as a parameter for each consumer chain.\n\n## Funding the Development\n\nBinary Builders is committed to build out the AAT for the Cosmos Hub. We think the AADAO is the most suitable venue to fund this work and they have expressed willingness to continue funding the project. However, considering their mandate is up for renewal, we will wait to seek funding until after the outcome of their upcoming governance proposal. Alternatively we would request funds from the community pool through an additional prop at a later stage.\n\nWe will include an updated and detailed specification and supporting documentation upon completion of the first version of the AAT.\n"},"authority":"cosmos10d07y265gmmuvt4z0w9aw880jnsr700j6zn9kn"}],"status":"PROPOSAL_STATUS_PASSED","final_tally_result":{"yes_count":"134407673454912","abstain_count":"2414743146637","no_count":"34709826319","no_with_veto_count":"177959253991"},"submit_time":"2023-12-15T12:07:22.528031944Z","deposit_end_time":"2023-12-29T12:07:22.528031944Z","total_deposit":[{"denom":"uatom","amount":"250000000"}],"voting_start_time":"2023-12-15T12:09:26.157613634Z","voting_end_time":"2023-12-29T12:09:26.157613634Z","metadata":"","title":"Development Approval Request for the ATOM Alignment Treasury","summary":"_This proposal and the research prior to it was funded by the AADAO. The forum discussion can be found [here](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/last-call-development-approval-request-for-the-atom-alignment-treasury/12188)._\n\n# Summary\n\nThis is a signal proposal requesting approval for the development of the first version of the ATOM Alignment Treasury (AAT) into the Cosmos Hub's software known as \"Gaia\", submitted by Binary Builders. It is a sentiment check to see whether ATOM holders believe time and resources should be allocated to this project. AADAO has signaled their willingness to fund development of the AAT.\n\nThe AAT is an infrastructural solution to two problems we've observed in the wild already:\n\n- **Liquidity deployment in the AEZ** such as the 450k ATOM in [prop 800](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/800) can help bootstrap new protocols in the AEZ. These are not investments where money is spent, but rather a relatively safe borrowing of liquidity where the Hub maintains control and is always able to clawback its funds to the Community Pool. However, these proposals still have to be manually executed and managed by a multi-signature wallet. This imposes friction and unnecessary risks that can be avoided when automating the process.\n- **Alignment between Consumer Chains and the Hub** is being formalized through measures such as Neutron's airdrop to the Hub's Community Pool. However, we have no mechanism in place that enables the Hub to vote on critical proposals on Consumer Chains. Ideally, ATOM Holders would be able to optionally vote on those networks with the full voting power the Hub has in the AAT.\n\nThe core logic of the AAT will be distributed in three independent and reusable modules. This is purely an infrastructural change to facilitate alignment within the AEZ and the use of Protocol Owned Liquidity (POL) in Liquidity-as-a-Service. This proposal does not favor any specific POL strategies to be deployed, nor does it request funds to be directed to the module at this point. Further requests for seeding the AAT through a community spend proposal or a tax rate will follow after the deployment of the module.\n\nA final governance proposal requesting approval of deployment will be submitted once development work has been completed in the first half of 2024.\n\n## Governance Votes\n\nThe following items summarize the voting options and their significance for this proposal:\n\n- YES - You agree that the ATOM Alignment Treasury should be developed by Binary Builders and that the problems outlined above require an infrastructural solution.\n- NO - You do not agree with the development of the ATOM Alignment Treasury, or do not believe that LaaS or alignment between Consumer Chains and the Hub require changes to the Gaia codebase.\n- NO WITH VETO - You consider this proposal (1) to be spam, i.e., irrelevant to Cosmos Hub, (2) disproportionately infringes on minority interests, or (3) violates or encourages violation of the rules of engagement as currently set out by Cosmos Hub governance. If the number of 'NoWithVeto' votes is greater than a third of total votes, the proposal is rejected and the deposits are burned.\n- ABSTAIN - You wish to contribute to quorum but you formally decline to vote either for or against the proposal.\n\n## What does the ATOM Alignment Treasury do?\n\nAt its core, the AAT holds funds to be deployed within the AEZ and any other protocol the Hub deems aligned with ATOM. It acts as a separation of accounting so that Protocol Owned Liquidity can be deployed and maintained separately from the Community Pool (CP). This healthy accounting separation will reduce the risk that the CP will be drained by multiple requests for liquidity deployment, and will guarantee funds remain available for grants and other required spendings.\n\n**As a core value, we believe the Hub should maintain direct access to its assets**. We do _not_ believe there is a future where a small group of individuals are managing assets that belong to the Cosmos Hub. There will be no committees or multi-signature wallets in control of the AAT.\n\nThe AAT module performs the following functions in three separate modules:\n\n- **Interchain Account Management**: the AAT can create and maintain accounts on Consumer Chains so that it can perform transactions on these chains. Account creations will occur in one bulk governance proposal after deployment.\n- **Governance on Consumer Chains**: the AAT periodically checks for active proposals on Consumer Chains using Interchain Queries and will maintain a list of props in the AAT. It will allow ATOM holders to \"clone\" critical proposals to the Hub, so that the Hub can vote on Consumer Chains with its POL.\n- **ICA Queue System**: in case the Hub wants to perform relatively simple POL actions such as bonding tokens on a Consumer Chain, a queue system is needed so that we can batch non-atomic transactions in one governance proposal. The staking process would require an IBC-transfer and a staking transaction. This would currently require two governance proposals because the IBC-transfer needs a few blocks to complete. A queue system can handle these confirmations and dramatically simplify the governance process.\n\nVersion 1 of the AAT **does not** include any logic that actively maintains position sizes.

Operators whose nodes become inactive on Neutron will be reallocated or returned to the Cosmos Hub Community Pool.\n- Validator allocations will be vested linearly over one year using dedicated contracts on Neutron.\n- A corresponding proposal will be made to the Neutron DAO to request the enabling of a voting vault to provide locked validator tokens with voting rights in Neutron governance.\n\n### Context\n\nFollowing the approval of [proposal 835 1](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/835) and [proposal N24](https://governance.neutron.org/proposals/24), the Cosmos Hub community pool received ~42,727,950 NTRN tokens (4.27% of max supply of NTRN) from the Neutron Airdrop. This NTRN materialises the close alignment between the Hub and Neutron, reinforced by the “Do no harm” and “Cooperation” policies ratified by the Cosmos Hub community.\n\nAt present market value (\u003e$0.80 NTRN 13.12.23) the transaction will equate to a return of \u003e$34,000,000 on its initial outlay of 50,000 ATOM to Neutron in [Prop 72.](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/72) Based on average monthly cost of validation estimates, this would equate to 15 to 30 years of security budget.\n\nThis redoubled incentive alignment between the networks creates massive opportunities for collaboration: joint ecosystem funding initiatives, strategic PoL to bolster the AEZ’s growth, liquidity bootstrapping programs to enshrine ATOM as money on Neutron and the AEZ, and more.\n\nAs an initial step, we propose to ensure that Cosmos Hub validators are properly incentivized to fully support Replicated Security and Neutron. To this effect, we propose to allocate 1.8M NTRN out of the 42M tokens (roughly ~4.2% of the Hub’s allocation) to support and incentivize validators running Neutron nodes.\n\n### Proposal\n\nWe propose an endowment of 10,000 NTRN per validator, to be linearly vested over a year using battle tested smart-contracts on Neutron. Assuming a corresponding proposal is ratified by the Neutron DAO, Cosmos Hub validators would benefit from voting rights in Neutron governance.\n\n- Validators who wish to cover infrastructure cost may claim and sell their tokens\n- Validators who wish to gain upside in Neutron’s success may hold their tokens and help steer the network towards success\n\nIn the absence of ICA controller functionality on Cosmos Hub, it is not possible to implement a fully trustless solution. In the interest of time and simplicity, we propose to start with a minimal solution that can be implemented in the coming weeks, according to the following steps:\n\n- Obtain governance approval from the Cosmos Hub and Neutron DAO\n- Transfer 1,800,000 NTRN to a DAODAO multisig on Neutron.\n- Allocate 10,000 NTRN per active Neutron validator to a vesting contract on Neutron.\n- Vest the tokens linearly over 12 months. Unlocked tokens can be claimed at any time.\n\nSince this proposal would release a large number of tokens into circulation, and in order to reinforce the collaborative precedent between the DAOs (having passed joint proposals for the airdrop transfer and more), a proposal to the Neutron DAO would be made to ensure it consents to the allocation of 1,800,000 NTRN. This would ensure that the Do No Harm and Cooperation clauses approved by the Cosmos Hub in [Prop 835](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/835) are explicitly respected, and would grant the validator allocations voting power in the Neutron DAO.\n\nThis structure is the most straightforward option and can be implemented in a short amount of time. It requires a committee to perform the IBC transfer and allocate the NTRN tokens to the vesting contracts.\n\nAddress: `cosmos1z2f2lh368k34j2rccnf8yz3rkuflulmuekvu4g`\n\n|Signer|Role|Address|\n|---|---|---|\n|Lexa|Hypha|cosmos1glgpeeadl7sttf5hed0s53zmxwrz3e4wtg27nx|\n|Ertemann|Lavender|cosmos1xfl6qve3plepgk7wlgxypem5ngntavrnkng3vz|\n|Clemens|CryptoCrew|cosmos1705swa2kgn9pvancafzl254f63a3jda9ngdnc7|\n|Spaydh|Neutron|cosmos1cpy2gpwc8lphzyczderwma2rt5nqdmvtqmkgqw|\n\nUpon successful passing of the proposal the full amount of 1,800,000 NTRN would be sent from the Cosmos Hub community pool to the above multisig, which would then perform an IBC transfer to Neutron and execute a message to register vesting allocations for each validator.\n\nThe multisig would retain the ability to edit/remove vesting schedules to easily handle circumstances such as:\n\n1.

A document outlining the general vision for these proposals is being drafted.\n\n**[[DRAFT PROPOSAL] Cosmos Hub \u0026 Neutron: Validator alignment](https://forum.neutron.org/t/draft-proposal-cosmos-hub-neutron-validator-alignment/247)**\n\n![https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard10/uploads/neutronorg/optimized/1X/bd777cb71504706779483782fb6e6a9fb735c873_2_32x32.png](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard10/uploads/neutronorg/optimized/1X/bd777cb71504706779483782fb6e6a9fb735c873_2_32x32.png)\n\n### Summary\n\n- Allocate 10,000 NTRN from the NTRN Airdrop to each Cosmos Hub validator running Neutron nodes to provide financial support and improve incentive alignment.\n- Validators opting to not run Neutron nodes after the 31st of December under the ‘soft opt-out’ feature will not be eligible.\n- Tokens are allocated to Cosmos Hub operators running active nodes on Neutron. Operators whose nodes become inactive on Neutron will be reallocated or returned to the Cosmos Hub Community Pool.\n- Validator allocations will be vested linearly over one year using dedicated contracts on Neutron.\n- A corresponding proposal will be made to the Neutron DAO to request the enabling of a voting vault to provide locked validator tokens with voting rights in Neutron governance.\n\n### Context\n\nFollowing the approval of [proposal 835 1](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/835) and [proposal N24](https://governance.neutron.org/proposals/24), the Cosmos Hub community pool received ~42,727,950 NTRN tokens (4.27% of max supply of NTRN) from the Neutron Airdrop. This NTRN materialises the close alignment between the Hub and Neutron, reinforced by the “Do no harm” and “Cooperation” policies ratified by the Cosmos Hub community.\n\nAt present market value (\u003e$0.80 NTRN 13.12.23) the transaction will equate to a return of \u003e$34,000,000 on its initial outlay of 50,000 ATOM to Neutron in [Prop 72.](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/72) Based on average monthly cost of validation estimates, this would equate to 15 to 30 years of security budget.\n\nThis redoubled incentive alignment between the networks creates massive opportunities for collaboration: joint ecosystem funding initiatives, strategic PoL to bolster the AEZ’s growth, liquidity bootstrapping programs to enshrine ATOM as money on Neutron and the AEZ, and more.\n\nAs an initial step, we propose to ensure that Cosmos Hub validators are properly incentivized to fully support Replicated Security and Neutron. To this effect, we propose to allocate 1.8M NTRN out of the 42M tokens (roughly ~4.2% of the Hub’s allocation) to support and incentivize validators running Neutron nodes.\n\n### Proposal\n\nWe propose an endowment of 10,000 NTRN per validator, to be linearly vested over a year using battle tested smart-contracts on Neutron. Assuming a corresponding proposal is ratified by the Neutron DAO, Cosmos Hub validators would benefit from voting rights in Neutron governance.\n\n- Validators who wish to cover infrastructure cost may claim and sell their tokens\n- Validators who wish to gain upside in Neutron’s success may hold their tokens and help steer the network towards success\n\nIn the absence of ICA controller functionality on Cosmos Hub, it is not possible to implement a fully trustless solution. In the interest of time and simplicity, we propose to start with a minimal solution that can be implemented in the coming weeks, according to the following steps:\n\n- Obtain governance approval from the Cosmos Hub and Neutron DAO\n- Transfer 1,800,000 NTRN to a DAODAO multisig on Neutron.\n- Allocate 10,000 NTRN per active Neutron validator to a vesting contract on Neutron.\n- Vest the tokens linearly over 12 months. Unlocked tokens can be claimed at any time.\n\nSince this proposal would release a large number of tokens into circulation, and in order to reinforce the collaborative precedent between the DAOs (having passed joint proposals for the airdrop transfer and more), a proposal to the Neutron DAO would be made to ensure it consents to the allocation of 1,800,000 NTRN. This would ensure that the Do No Harm and Cooperation clauses approved by the Cosmos Hub in [Prop 835](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/835) are explicitly respected, and would grant the validator allocations voting power in the Neutron DAO.\n\nThis structure is the most straightforward option and can be implemented in a short amount of time. It requires a committee to perform the IBC transfer and allocate the NTRN tokens to the vesting contracts.\n\nAddress: `cosmos1z2f2lh368k34j2rccnf8yz3rkuflulmuekvu4g`\n\n|Signer|Role|Address|\n|---|---|---|\n|Lexa|Hypha|cosmos1glgpeeadl7sttf5hed0s53zmxwrz3e4wtg27nx|\n|Ertemann|Lavender|cosmos1xfl6qve3plepgk7wlgxypem5ngntavrnkng3vz|\n|Clemens|CryptoCrew|cosmos1705swa2kgn9pvancafzl254f63a3jda9ngdnc7|\n|Spaydh|Neutron|cosmos1cpy2gpwc8lphzyczderwma2rt5nqdmvtqmkgqw|\n\nUpon successful passing of the proposal the full amount of 1,800,000 NTRN would be sent from the Cosmos Hub community pool to the above multisig, which would then perform an IBC transfer to Neutron and execute a message to register vesting allocations for each validator.\n\nThe multisig would retain the ability to edit/remove vesting schedules to easily handle circumstances such as:\n\n1. An operator key has been compromised and the vesting schedule needs to be registered to their new operator address.\n2. An operator is no longer an active validator on Neutron and the remaining tokens need to be returned to the Cosmos Hub CP or registered to a different operator which has replaced them in the active set.\n3. Etc.\n\nAny tokens remaining at the end of the period would be returned to the Cosmos Hub community pool before the multisig is disbanded.\n\n### Governance votes\n\nThe following items summarize the voting options and what they mean for this proposal:\n\n**YES**: You wish to transfer 1,800,000 NTRN tokens from the Community Pool to the dedicated multisig to be allocated to validators running active Neutron nodes.\n\n**NO**: You do not wish to transfer 1,800,000 NTRN tokens from the Community Pool to the dedicated multisig to be allocated to validators running active Neutron nodes.\n\n**ABSTAIN**: You wish to contribute to the quorum but you formally decline to vote either for or against the proposal.\n\n**NO WITH VETO**: A ‘NoWithVeto’ vote indicates a proposal either (1) is deemed to be spam, i.e., irrelevant to Cosmos Hub, (2) disproportionately infringes on minority interests, or (3) violates or encourages violation of the rules of engagement as currently set out by Cosmos Hub governance.

After collecting forum feedback (~ 1 week) and adapting the proposal as required, a governance proposal will be sent to the Cosmos Hub for voting. The on-chain voting period typically lasts 2 weeks.\n\nOn governance vote approval, validators will be required to update the Cosmos Hub binary at the halt-height specified in the on-chain proposal.\n\n### Release Binary\n\nIMPORTANT: Note that [Gaia v15.0.0 binary](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/releases/tag/v15.0.0-rc3) MUST be used.\n\n### Proposed Release Contents\n\nThe relevant Github epic for this release is: [Gaia v15 Release](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/issues/2790)\n\nThe focus of this release is the upgrade of Cosmos SDK to v0.47 -- this release uses [v0.47.8-ics-lsm](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/tree/v0.47.8-ics-lsm), a special Cosmos SDK branch with support for both ICS and LSM. Consequently, it also upgrades the following dependencies:\n\n- IBC to [v7.3.1](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/releases/tag/v7.3.1)\n- CometBFT to [v0.37.4](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/releases/tag/v0.37.4)\n- Interchain Security to [v3.3.1-lsm](https://github.com/cosmos/interchain-security/releases/tag/v3.3.1-lsm)\n- Packet Forward Middleware to [v7.1.2](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-apps/releases/tag/middleware%2Fpacket-forward-middleware%2Fv7.1.2)\n\nIn addition, this release migrates the following state:\n\n- Sets the min commission rate staking parameter to `5%` and updates the commission rate for all validators accordingly (according to [governance proposal 826](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/826)). Validators with a commission rate \u003c `5%` prior to upgrade will have a rate of `5%` after upgrade is complete. This parameter can be changed via a param change proposal in the future.\n- Migrates the vesting funds from *cosmos145hytrc49m0hn6fphp8d5h4xspwkawcuzmx498*to the community pool (according to [governance proposal 860](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/860)).\n\nFinally, this releases fixes a series of issues found during the [Oak Security audit of SDK 0.47](https://github.com/oak-security/audit-reports/blob/master/Cosmos%20SDK/2024-01-23%20Audit%20Report%20-%20Cosmos%20SDK%20v1.0.pdf). As a result, this release introduces the following API changes:\n\n- Reject `MsgVote` messages from accounts with less than 1 ATOM staked. All validators should ensure that they are staking at least 1 ATOM from the wallet they use for sending `MsgVote` messages.\n- A new `MinDepositRatio` param is added (with a default value of `0.01`) and now deposits are required to be at least `MinDepositRatio*MinDeposit` to be accepted.\n\nTaken together, these changes upgrade Gaia from cosmos-sdk v0.45 and open the door for further integrations, such as adding Skip Block SDK required by [Prop 842](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/842).\n\n### Testing and Testnets\n\nThe v15 release has gone through rigorous testing, including e2e tests, integration tests, and differential tests. Differential tests are similar to integration tests, but they compare the system state to an expected state generated from a model implementation. In addition, v15 has been independently tested by the team at Hypha Co-op.\n\nValidators and node operators have joined a public testnet to participate in a test upgrade to a release candidate before the Cosmos Hub upgrades to the final release. You can find the relevant information (genesis file, peers, etc.) to join the Release testnet https://github.com/cosmos/testnets/tree/master/public (theta-testnet-001), or the Replicated Security testnet https://github.com/cosmos/testnets/tree/master/replicated-security (provider).\n\n### Potential risk factors\n\nAlthough very extensive testing and simulation will have taken place there always exists a risk that the Cosmos Hub might experience problems due to potential bugs or errors from the new features.

After collecting forum feedback (~ 1 week) and adapting the proposal as required, a governance proposal will be sent to the Cosmos Hub for voting. The on-chain voting period typically lasts 2 weeks.\n\nOn governance vote approval, validators will be required to update the Cosmos Hub binary at the halt-height specified in the on-chain proposal.\n\n### Release Binary\n\nIMPORTANT: Note that [Gaia v15.0.0 binary](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/releases/tag/v15.0.0-rc3) MUST be used.\n\n### Proposed Release Contents\n\nThe relevant Github epic for this release is: [Gaia v15 Release](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/issues/2790)\n\nThe focus of this release is the upgrade of Cosmos SDK to v0.47 -- this release uses [v0.47.8-ics-lsm](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/tree/v0.47.8-ics-lsm), a special Cosmos SDK branch with support for both ICS and LSM. Consequently, it also upgrades the following dependencies:\n\n- IBC to [v7.3.1](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/releases/tag/v7.3.1)\n- CometBFT to [v0.37.4](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/releases/tag/v0.37.4)\n- Interchain Security to [v3.3.1-lsm](https://github.com/cosmos/interchain-security/releases/tag/v3.3.1-lsm)\n- Packet Forward Middleware to [v7.1.2](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-apps/releases/tag/middleware%2Fpacket-forward-middleware%2Fv7.1.2)\n\nIn addition, this release migrates the following state:\n\n- Sets the min commission rate staking parameter to `5%` and updates the commission rate for all validators accordingly (according to [governance proposal 826](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/826)). Validators with a commission rate \u003c `5%` prior to upgrade will have a rate of `5%` after upgrade is complete. This parameter can be changed via a param change proposal in the future.\n- Migrates the vesting funds from *cosmos145hytrc49m0hn6fphp8d5h4xspwkawcuzmx498*to the community pool (according to [governance proposal 860](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/860)).\n\nFinally, this releases fixes a series of issues found during the [Oak Security audit of SDK 0.47](https://github.com/oak-security/audit-reports/blob/master/Cosmos%20SDK/2024-01-23%20Audit%20Report%20-%20Cosmos%20SDK%20v1.0.pdf). As a result, this release introduces the following API changes:\n\n- Reject `MsgVote` messages from accounts with less than 1 ATOM staked. All validators should ensure that they are staking at least 1 ATOM from the wallet they use for sending `MsgVote` messages.\n- A new `MinDepositRatio` param is added (with a default value of `0.01`) and now deposits are required to be at least `MinDepositRatio*MinDeposit` to be accepted.\n\nTaken together, these changes upgrade Gaia from cosmos-sdk v0.45 and open the door for further integrations, such as adding Skip Block SDK required by [Prop 842](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/842).\n\n### Testing and Testnets\n\nThe v15 release has gone through rigorous testing, including e2e tests, integration tests, and differential tests. Differential tests are similar to integration tests, but they compare the system state to an expected state generated from a model implementation. In addition, v15 has been independently tested by the team at Hypha Co-op.\n\nValidators and node operators have joined a public testnet to participate in a test upgrade to a release candidate before the Cosmos Hub upgrades to the final release. You can find the relevant information (genesis file, peers, etc.) to join the Release testnet https://github.com/cosmos/testnets/tree/master/public (theta-testnet-001), or the Replicated Security testnet https://github.com/cosmos/testnets/tree/master/replicated-security (provider).\n\n### Potential risk factors\n\nAlthough very extensive testing and simulation will have taken place there always exists a risk that the Cosmos Hub might experience problems due to potential bugs or errors from the new features. In the case of serious problems, validators should stop operating the network immediately.\n\nCoordination with validators will happen in the [#cosmos-hub-validators-verified](https://discord.com/channels/669268347736686612/798937713474142229) channel of the Cosmos Network Discord to create and execute a contingency plan. Likely this will be an emergency release with fixes or the recommendation to consider the upgrade aborted and revert back to the previous release of gaia (v14).\n\n### Governance votes\n\nThe following items summarize the voting options and what it means for this proposal:\n\n**YES** - You agree that the Cosmos Hub should be updated with this release.\n\n**NO** - You disagree that the Cosmos Hub should be updated with this release.\n\n**NO WITH VETO** - A ‘NoWithVeto’ vote indicates a proposal either (1) is deemed to be spam, i.e., irrelevant to Cosmos Hub, (2) disproportionately infringes on minority interests, or (3) violates or encourages violation of the rules of engagement as currently set out by Cosmos Hub governance.

The mechanism to off-board funds would be via any bridges to other chains or via IBC support. A rate limiting feature would limit the amount of incoming and outgoing traffic from a particular network that matches a specific criteria.\n\n## Previous Exploits and Other Implementations\nExamples of previous real or potential exploits on the Cosmos Hub and other ecosystems are shown below:\n\n- [Polynetwork Bridge Hack](https://rekt.news/polynetwork-rekt/) ($611 million)\n- [BNB Bridge Hack](https://rekt.news/bnb-bridge-rekt/) ($586 million)\n- [Wormhole Bridge Hack](https://rekt.news/wormhole-rekt/) ($326 million)\n- [Nomad Bridge Hack](https://rekt.news/nomad-rekt/) ($190 million)\n- [Harmony Bridge Hack](https://rekt.news/harmony-rekt/) ($100 million)\n- [Dragonberry IBC bug](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/ibc-security-advisory-dragonberry/7702)\n\n\nThe rate limiting technique is a useful tool that is implemented in a variety of scenarios, including the area of financial transactions, for example [on the Osmosis chain](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/tree/v23.0.0/x/ibc-rate-limit).\n\n## Proposal\nWe propose adding the [Rate Limit module](https://github.com/Stride-Labs/ibc-rate-limiting) developed by Stride Labs to the Cosmos Hub. The module prevents massive inflows or outflows of IBC tokens in a short time frame (e.g., 24 hour window). Every rate limit is applied at a `ChannelID + Denom` granularity. For example, a rate limit could be added for `uatom` on the Cosmos Hub \u003c\u003e Osmosis channel (`channel-141`).  \n\nEvery rate limit will also have a configurable threshold that dictates the max inflow/outflow along the channel. The threshold is represented as a percentage of the total supply of the denom at the start of the time window, and it remains constant until the window expires. For instance, the rate limit for `uatom` on `channel-141` might have a threshold of 5% for both inflow and outflow. Given the total supply of 388M  ATOMs, such a rate limit would reject any IBC transfer that would cause a net inflow or outflow greater than 19.4M ATOMs. Once the time window expires, the net inflow and outflow are reset to 0.\n\nInitially, we propose the add the following (conservative) rate limits (for both inflow and outflow) with a 24 hour time window:\n* 5% for `uatom` on Cosmos Hub \u003c\u003e Osmosis (`channel-141`) – a net flow of 19.4M ATOMs / day\n* 1% for `uatom` on Cosmos Hub \u003c\u003e Neutron (`channel-569`) – a net flow of 3.9M ATOMs / day\n* 1% for `uatom` on Cosmos Hub \u003c\u003e Stride (`channel-391`) – a net flow of 3.9M ATOMs / day\n* 1% for `uatom` on Cosmos Hub \u003c\u003e Kujira (`channel-343`) – a net flow of 3.9M ATOMs / day\n* 1% for `uatom` on Cosmos Hub \u003c\u003e Injective (`channel-220`) – a net flow of 3.9M ATOMs / day\n* 1% for `uatom` on Cosmos Hub \u003c\u003e Persistence (`channel-190`) – a net flow of 3.9M ATOMs / day\n* 1% for `uatom` on Cosmos Hub \u003c\u003e Secret (`channel-235`) – a net flow of 3.9M ATOMs / day\n\nThese limits are conservative enough to avoid false positives – user transfers being rejected – while still providing an initial protection against exploits. The proposed values are based on the following back-of-the-envelope calculation: In the last 14 days, ~400.000 ATOMs were transferred out of the Hub on average per day, which is ~ 0.1% of the total ATOM supply, and most of this is transferred to Osmosis (more than 90%). This makes the suggested 5% limit large enough to avoid false positives. \n\nOnce these rate limits are added, both the inflow and outflow on these channels can be monitored (`gaiad q ratelimit list-rate-limits`) and the limits can be adjusted accordingly. Note that the Rate Limit module enables rate limits to be added and updated via governance proposals.   \n\n## Proposal Outcomes\nThe following items summarize the voting options and what they mean for this proposal:\n\n**Upon a YES vote:**\n* The [Rate Limit module](https://github.com/Stride-Labs/ibc-rate-limiting) developed by Stride Labs will be integrated into Gaia and rolled out in one of the next major releases.  \n\n**Upon a NO vote:**\n* The Rate Limit module will not be added to the Hub and the discussions with the community will continue to find the best path forward to introduce the rate limiting feature that helps to protect user funds.\n\n**NO WITH VETO** - A ‘NoWithVeto’ vote indicates a proposal either (1) is deemed to be spam, i.e., irrelevant to Cosmos Hub, (2) disproportionately infringes on minority interests, or (3) violates or encourages violation of the rules of engagement as currently set out by Cosmos Hub governance.

A rate limiting feature would limit the amount of incoming and outgoing traffic from a particular network that matches a specific criteria.\n\n## Previous Exploits and Other Implementations\nExamples of previous real or potential exploits on the Cosmos Hub and other ecosystems are shown below:\n\n- [Polynetwork Bridge Hack](https://rekt.news/polynetwork-rekt/) ($611 million)\n- [BNB Bridge Hack](https://rekt.news/bnb-bridge-rekt/) ($586 million)\n- [Wormhole Bridge Hack](https://rekt.news/wormhole-rekt/) ($326 million)\n- [Nomad Bridge Hack](https://rekt.news/nomad-rekt/) ($190 million)\n- [Harmony Bridge Hack](https://rekt.news/harmony-rekt/) ($100 million)\n- [Dragonberry IBC bug](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/ibc-security-advisory-dragonberry/7702)\n\n\nThe rate limiting technique is a useful tool that is implemented in a variety of scenarios, including the area of financial transactions, for example [on the Osmosis chain](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/tree/v23.0.0/x/ibc-rate-limit).\n\n## Proposal\nWe propose adding the [Rate Limit module](https://github.com/Stride-Labs/ibc-rate-limiting) developed by Stride Labs to the Cosmos Hub. The module prevents massive inflows or outflows of IBC tokens in a short time frame (e.g., 24 hour window). Every rate limit is applied at a `ChannelID + Denom` granularity. For example, a rate limit could be added for `uatom` on the Cosmos Hub \u003c\u003e Osmosis channel (`channel-141`).  \n\nEvery rate limit will also have a configurable threshold that dictates the max inflow/outflow along the channel. The threshold is represented as a percentage of the total supply of the denom at the start of the time window, and it remains constant until the window expires. For instance, the rate limit for `uatom` on `channel-141` might have a threshold of 5% for both inflow and outflow. Given the total supply of 388M  ATOMs, such a rate limit would reject any IBC transfer that would cause a net inflow or outflow greater than 19.4M ATOMs. Once the time window expires, the net inflow and outflow are reset to 0.\n\nInitially, we propose the add the following (conservative) rate limits (for both inflow and outflow) with a 24 hour time window:\n* 5% for `uatom` on Cosmos Hub \u003c\u003e Osmosis (`channel-141`) – a net flow of 19.4M ATOMs / day\n* 1% for `uatom` on Cosmos Hub \u003c\u003e Neutron (`channel-569`) – a net flow of 3.9M ATOMs / day\n* 1% for `uatom` on Cosmos Hub \u003c\u003e Stride (`channel-391`) – a net flow of 3.9M ATOMs / day\n* 1% for `uatom` on Cosmos Hub \u003c\u003e Kujira (`channel-343`) – a net flow of 3.9M ATOMs / day\n* 1% for `uatom` on Cosmos Hub \u003c\u003e Injective (`channel-220`) – a net flow of 3.9M ATOMs / day\n* 1% for `uatom` on Cosmos Hub \u003c\u003e Persistence (`channel-190`) – a net flow of 3.9M ATOMs / day\n* 1% for `uatom` on Cosmos Hub \u003c\u003e Secret (`channel-235`) – a net flow of 3.9M ATOMs / day\n\nThese limits are conservative enough to avoid false positives – user transfers being rejected – while still providing an initial protection against exploits. The proposed values are based on the following back-of-the-envelope calculation: In the last 14 days, ~400.000 ATOMs were transferred out of the Hub on average per day, which is ~ 0.1% of the total ATOM supply, and most of this is transferred to Osmosis (more than 90%). This makes the suggested 5% limit large enough to avoid false positives. \n\nOnce these rate limits are added, both the inflow and outflow on these channels can be monitored (`gaiad q ratelimit list-rate-limits`) and the limits can be adjusted accordingly. Note that the Rate Limit module enables rate limits to be added and updated via governance proposals.   \n\n## Proposal Outcomes\nThe following items summarize the voting options and what they mean for this proposal:\n\n**Upon a YES vote:**\n* The [Rate Limit module](https://github.com/Stride-Labs/ibc-rate-limiting) developed by Stride Labs will be integrated into Gaia and rolled out in one of the next major releases.  \n\n**Upon a NO vote:**\n* The Rate Limit module will not be added to the Hub and the discussions with the community will continue to find the best path forward to introduce the rate limiting feature that helps to protect user funds.\n\n**NO WITH VETO** - A ‘NoWithVeto’ vote indicates a proposal either (1) is deemed to be spam, i.e., irrelevant to Cosmos Hub, (2) disproportionately infringes on minority interests, or (3) violates or encourages violation of the rules of engagement as currently set out by Cosmos Hub governance. If the number of ‘NoWithVeto’ votes is greater than a third of total votes, the proposal is rejected and the deposits are burned\n\n**ABSTAIN** - You wish to contribute to quorum but you formally decline to vote either for or against the proposal\n\n\n## References\n\n* This proposal references the existing [Github Issue](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/issues/1945) and the [technical discussion](https://github.com/informalsystems/interchain/blob/main/security/rate-limiter.md).\n* A [CosmWasm implementation](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/tree/v23.0.0/x/ibc-rate-limit) of the Rate Limit module can be found on the Osmosis chain.\n* A [specification](https://github.com/informalsystems/interchain/blob/main/security/rate-limiter.md) of the Osmosis implementation of the Rate Limit module. \n* A [Cosmos SDK implementation](https://github.com/Stride-Labs/stride/tree/v18.0.0/x/ratelimit) of the Rate Limit module can be found on the Stride chain. \n* The Rate Limit module developed by Stride was also ported into [its own module](https://github.com/Stride-Labs/ibc-rate-limiting) that can be used by other chains, such as the Cosmos Hub.\n","proposer":""},{"id":"891","messages":[{"@type":"/cosmos.gov.v1.MsgExecLegacyContent","content":{"@type":"/cosmos.gov.v1beta1.TextProposal","title":"Allocate 900k ATOM for The Next -

Proposal 899 passed on 16 April 2024 with 60.1% turnout and 61.5% yes votes.\n\nThis proposal is to pilot an allocation of 4% of Cosmos Community Pool’s idle ATOM for liquid staking on Stride (stATOM) and Persistence (stkATOM) and use these tokens throughout the Cosmos Ecosystem to deepen liquidity while generating value for the Hub. The staked assets will be managed by a multisig, whose administrators are directed to deposit stATOM and stkATOM into Inter Protocol Vaults to mint IST and provide LP to numerous liquidity pools throughout the Cosmos ecosystem. After an initial 3-month period, an additional 6% will be allocated to achieve a 10% total allocation of Community pool to earn these ecosystem and staking rewards, deepening Cosmos liquidity throughout various appchains.\n\nThe amount of ATOM to be transferred is 188,768\nThis is based on the Community Pool of 4.681M total as of April 19, 2024, at 4% of the pool or 188,768 ATOM ~ US$1,555,448.32 (based on ATOM at $8.24).\n 90% will be staked with stATOM and 10% will be staked with stkATOM\n\nThe community spend of 4% (188,768 ATOM) of the Cosmos Community Pool ATOM will be staked via stATOM and stkATOM in the first quarter as a pilot program, increasing by 6% of the ATOM Community Pool (approximately 283,152 ATOM) to achieve a total 10% of Cosmos Hub Community Pool in the next quarter to achieve a final amount of approximately 471,920 ATOM devoted to this effort. The estimated increase in the total capital efficiency on the original ATOM is ~18% based on current market conditions (market conditions subject to change).\n\n\n\nThe multisig that will implement this proposal, until Covenant by Timewave, or an acceptable equivalent, is available, \nis wallet address: cosmos18d3gg43rlrmudvcdrgdects3v5cd3w6ds7646v\nAnd consists of: \n* Zaki Manian\n* Riley Edmunds\n* Dean Tribble\n* Josh Lee\n* Bart Van der Voort\n* Carter Woetzel\n* Jack Zampolin\n\nThe initial pools to be used are:\n* 30% to Osmosis IST/USDC Concentrated Liquidity pool \n* 25% to Astroport IST/USDC.nbl pool\n* 15% to Astrovault IST/USDC.nbl pool\n* 15% to Shade IST/SILK pool\n* 15% to a Quasar IST/USDC vault\n","proposer":"cosmos1tpgpsfrthj2ujj7kyg4qewradzzdd5zm0sj2dr"},{"id":"914","messages":[{"@type":"/cosmos.gov.v1.MsgExecLegacyContent","content":{"@type":"/cosmos.upgrade.v1beta1.SoftwareUpgradeProposal","title":"Gaia v16 Software Upgrade","description":"### Background\n\nThe **Gaia v16** release is a major release that will follow the standard governance process by initially submitting this post on the Cosmos Hub forum. After collecting forum feedback (~ 1 week) and adapting the proposal as required, a governance proposal will be sent to the Cosmos Hub for voting. The on-chain voting period typically lasts 2 weeks.\n\nOn governance vote approval, validators will be required to update the Cosmos Hub binary at the halt-height specified in the on-chain proposal.\n\n### Release Binary \u0026 Upgrade Resources\n\nIMPORTANT: Note that Gaia v16.0.0 binary MUST be used.\n\n- The release can be found [here](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/releases/tag/v16.0.0).\n- The changelog can be found [here](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/blob/v16.0.0/CHANGELOG.md).\n- The upgrade guide can be found [here](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/blob/release/v16.x/UPGRADING.md).\n\n### Proposed Release Contents\n\nThe relevant Github epic for this release is: [Gaia v16 Release](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/issues/2868)\n\nThis release introduces the following new features:\n- ICA Controller sub-module\n- IBC Rate Limit [module](https://github.com/Stride-Labs/ibc-rate-limiting) with initial rate limits as outlined in [Prop 890](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/890)\n- IBC Fee module\n- ICS epochs (part of ICS v4.1.0)\n\nThis upgrade also bumps the following dependencies:\n- Bump PFM to v7.1.3\n- Bump ibc-go to v7.4.0\n- Bump cosmos-sdk to v0.47.13-ics-lsm. This is a special cosmos-sdk branch with support for both ICS and LSM\n- Bump ICS to v4.1.1-lsm\n\n### Testing and Testnets\n\nThe v16 release has gone through rigorous testing, including e2e tests, integration tests, and differential tests. Differential tests are similar to integration tests, but they compare the system state to an expected state generated from a model implementation. In addition, v16 has been independently tested by the team at Hypha Co-op.\n\nValidators and node operators have joined a public testnet to participate in a test upgrade to a release candidate before the Cosmos Hub upgrades to the final release. You can find the relevant information (genesis file, peers, etc.) to join the [Release testnet](https://github.com/cosmos/testnets/tree/master/release) (`theta-testnet-001`), or the [Interchain Security testnet](https://github.com/cosmos/testnets/tree/master/interchain-security) (`provider`).\n\n### Potential risk factors\n\nAlthough very extensive testing and simulation will have taken place there always exists a risk that the Cosmos Hub might experience problems due to potential bugs or errors from the new features. In the case of serious problems, validators should stop operating the network immediately.\n\nCoordination with validators will happen in the [#cosmos-hub-validators-verified](https://discord.com/channels/669268347736686612/798937713474142229) channel of the Cosmos Network Discord to create and execute a contingency plan. Likely this will be an emergency release with fixes or the recommendation to consider the upgrade aborted and revert back to the previous release of gaia (v15).\n\n### Governance votes\n\nThe following items summarize the voting options and what it means for this proposal:\n\n**YES** - You agree that the Cosmos Hub should be updated with this release.\n\n**NO** - You disagree that the Cosmos Hub should be updated with this release.\n\n**NO WITH VETO** - A ‘NoWithVeto’ vote indicates a proposal either (1) is deemed to be spam, i.e., irrelevant to Cosmos Hub, (2) disproportionately infringes on minority interests, or (3) violates or encourages violation of the rules of engagement as currently set out by Cosmos Hub governance. If the number of ‘NoWithVeto’ votes is greater than a third of total votes, the proposal is rejected and the deposits are burned.\n\n**ABSTAIN** - You wish to contribute to the quorum but you formally decline to vote either for or against the proposal.","plan":{"name":"v16","time":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","height":"20440500","info":"{ \"binaries\": { \"darwin/amd64\":\"https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/releases/download/v16.0.0/gaiad-v16.0.0-darwin-amd64?checksum=sha256:e2c8fe39907c788007d878ca55b61ac9d52f354a795e580ff29dfd5c48de90b5\", \"darwin/arm64\":\"https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/releases/download/v16.0.0/gaiad-v16.0.0-darwin-arm64?checksum=sha256:90805a7e0c595b1c0c8417716e797e7a06676aa8b6110d5ed4e0021469255f2e\", \"linux/amd64\":\"https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/releases/download/v16.0.0/gaiad-v16.0.0-linux-amd64?checksum=sha256:5440dcc28d101e7ad7421048e3339891b7ee7a8f576e6639f05f2fdbee5feda2\", \"linux/arm64\":\"https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/releases/download/v16.0.0/gaiad-v16.0.0-linux-arm64?checksum=sha256:2d190c6ca37a45940af4c6f2a0d901b7fdc210a5896b77d728160c2753ee13bd\", \"windows/amd64\":\"https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/releases/download/v16.0.0/gaiad-v16.0.0-windows-amd64.exe?checksum=sha256:a3f3180abb4525cad1f1ed334100e95cb600487aa55d3ff8cf6a005d1fe3f39c\", \"windows/arm64\":\"https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/releases/download/v16.0.0/gaiad-v16.0.0-windows-arm64.exe?checksum=sha256:d19afd55d1401e1152ac7df6808b2cf46514375d21755158a1c3e05ff02e4f35\"}}","upgraded_client_state":null}},"authority":"cosmos10d07y265gmmuvt4z0w9aw880jnsr700j6zn9kn"}],"status":"PROPOSAL_STATUS_PASSED","final_tally_result":{"yes_count":"144668816859241","abstain_count":"234562352024","no_count":"27017980667","no_with_veto_count":"24624457671"},"submit_time":"2024-04-26T13:59:03.714825464Z","deposit_end_time":"2024-05-10T13:59:03.714825464Z","total_deposit":[{"denom":"uatom","amount":"250000000"}],"voting_start_time":"2024-04-26T13:59:03.714825464Z","voting_end_time":"2024-05-10T13:59:03.714825464Z","metadata":"","title":"Gaia v16 Software Upgrade","summary":"### Background\n\nThe **Gaia v16** release is a major release that will follow the standard governance process by initially submitting this post on the Cosmos Hub forum.
