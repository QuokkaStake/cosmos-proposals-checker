This updated prop corrects a tooling error - no \"prop_type\" set on #916. Please ignore previous proposal.\n\nPlease find the detailed proposal forum post here: https://forum.cosmos.network/t/proposal-last-call-dorahacks-aez-quadratic-funding-program/13618\n\nAs seen in its rich history, the Cosmos Hub, which birthed and bootstrapped the most open source and decentralized developer community seen thus far in the web3 industry, has one of the most active and robust governance mechanisms and participants. In a similar vein, Public Goods funding has also always been of crucial importance to the Hub’s stakeholders.\n\nTo further this mission, Dora Factory and Atom Accelerator DAO hope to run 10 Quadratic Funding (QF) rounds over the next 24 months, with a total prize pool of 100,000 ATOMs. This will equate to a prize pool of approximately 10,000 ATOMs each round, to fund public goods and developer teams bringing value to the Atom Economic Zone. These public goods will be of utmost importance as the AEZ enters its parabolic growth phase with the upcoming ICS 2.0 (Partial Set Security).\n\nDora Factory has run 20+ ecosystem QF rounds in the past four years, including the first-ever AEZ round, which garnered $10k in community contributions, which were matched with $60k from the prize pool.\n\nDora now turns to the Cosmos Hub community treasury, to formally introduce this program to the community, and scale this initiative to a meaningful size.\n\n## Governance Votes\n\nThe following items summarize the voting options and their significance for this proposal:\n\nYES - You agree that the Cosmos Hub community should support the expansion of the AEZ Quadratic Funding program, and contribute 80,000 ATOM to the overall developer matching pool.\n\nNO - You do not agree with the expansion of the AEZ Quadratic Funding program, or do not believe the Cosmos Hub treasury should support this effort .\n\nNO WITH VETO - You consider this proposal (1) to be spam, i.e., irrelevant to Cosmos Hub, (2) disproportionately infringes on minority interests, or (3) violates or encourages violation of the rules of engagement as currently set out by Cosmos Hub governance. If the number of ‘NoWithVeto’ votes is greater than a third of total votes, the proposal is rejected and the deposits are burned.\n\nABSTAIN - You wish to contribute to quorum but you formally decline to vote either for or against the proposal.","proposer":"cosmos1reae9gp0lq67lezg6npf2kh3uyp2zt8hquljx3"},{"id":"919","messages":[{"@type":"/cosmos.gov.v1.MsgExecLegacyContent","content":{"@type":"/cosmos.gov.v1beta1.TextProposal","title":"⚡ Avail x Cosmos airdrop⚡","description":"According to tokenomics: [cosmos-network.io][1] stakers can receive an airdrop.

After collecting forum feedback (~ 1 week) and adapting the proposal as required, a governance proposal will be sent to the Cosmos Hub for voting. The on-chain voting period typically lasts 2 weeks.\n\nOn governance vote approval, validators will be required to update the Cosmos Hub binary at the halt-height specified in the on-chain proposal.\n\n### Release Binary \u0026 Upgrade Resources\n\nIMPORTANT: Note that Gaia v17.0.0 binary MUST be used.\n- The release can be found [here](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/releases/tag/v17.0.0).\n- The changelog can be found [here](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/blob/v17.0.0/CHANGELOG.md).\n- The upgrade guide can be found [here](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/blob/release/v17.x/UPGRADING.md).\n\n### Release Contents\n\nThis release adds [**Partial Set Security (PSS)**](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/897) features to the Cosmos Hub blockchain. When the PSS enabled chain binary lands on mainnet, new consumer chains will be able to:\n- choose the % of Cosmos Hub's voting power that is required to operate the consumer chain\n- use allow/denylists to customize validator participation\n- choose a per-validator voting power maximum (voting power cap)\n- use a different number of validators compared to the Cosmos Hub (validator number cap)\n- choose to run as an \"Opt-in\" chain (running the chain is not mandatory for validators)\n- have validators choose a different commission rate on their chain\n\n### Stride and Neutron Change-over to Top N=95% Chains\n*Information here is provided by Lexa from Hypha, directly from their work on the Hub’s ICS Testnet.*\n\nAfter the v17 upgrade, Stride and Neutron will both automatically become Top N=95% chains, but will retain the 5% soft opt-out logic implemented on the consumer side.\n\n**Impact on immediate operations**\n- **Top 95% of Hub Validators:** The top 95% of Hub validators (by voting power) will experience no change in operations and will automatically continue to validate Stride and Neutron.\n- **Bottom 5% of Hub Validators:** Any validators in the bottom 5% who are **currently** validating Stride or Neutron will have their node unbonded and see “This node is not a validator” upon restarting. **To continue validating, you must send an opt-in transaction for each chain.**\n\n**Impact on consumer chain security**\nBoth Stride and Neutron are currently Replicated Security chains with a 5% soft opt-out.\n- **Current state:** both chains are secured by 95% of the Hub’s active set (100% of the set is mandated to run the chain but the bottom 5% of the mandated faces no penalties for not running it).\n- **State created by this update:** a Top N=95% chain with a 5% soft opt-out is guaranteed to be secured by 90% of the Hub’s active set (95% of the set is mandated to run, but the bottom 5% of the mandated set faces no penalties for not running it).\n\nStride and Neutron may choose to remove the soft opt-out feature on the consumer side in a future consumer upgrade, which would result in 95% of the Hub’s active set being mandated to run the consumer chains. This was the original logic intended by Replicated Security with a 5% soft opt-out.\n\n### Testing and Testnets\n\nThe v17 release has gone through rigorous testing, including e2e tests, integration tests, and differential tests. Differential tests are similar to integration tests, but they compare the system state to an expected state generated from a model implementation. In addition, v17 has been independently tested by the team at Hypha Co-op.\n\nValidators and node operators have joined a public testnet to participate in a test upgrade to a release candidate before the Cosmos Hub upgrades to the final release. You can find the relevant information (genesis file, peers, etc.) to join the [Release testnet](https://github.com/cosmos/testnets/tree/master/public)  (theta-testnet-001), or the [Interchain Security testnet](https://github.com/cosmos/testnets/tree/master/interchain-security) (provider).\n\n### Potential risk factors\n\nAlthough very extensive testing and simulation will have taken place there always exists a risk that the Cosmos Hub might experience problems due to potential bugs or errors from the new features. In the case of serious problems, validators should stop operating the network immediately.\n\nCoordination with validators will happen in the [#cosmos-hub-validators-verified](https://discord.com/channels/669268347736686612/798937713474142229) channel of the Cosmos Network Discord to create and execute a contingency plan. Likely this will be an emergency release with fixes or the recommendation to consider the upgrade aborted and revert back to the previous release of gaia (v16).\n\n### Governance votes\n\nThe following items summarize the voting options and what it means for this proposal:\n\n**YES** - You agree that the Cosmos Hub should be updated with this release.\n\n**NO** - You disagree that the Cosmos Hub should be updated with this release.\n\n**NO WITH VETO** - A ‘NoWithVeto’ vote indicates a proposal either (1) is deemed to be spam, i.e., irrelevant to Cosmos Hub, (2) disproportionately infringes on minority interests, or (3) violates or encourages violation of the rules of engagement as currently set out by Cosmos Hub governance.

Expedited proposals can have shorter voting durations and a higher tally threshold. If an expedited proposal fails to meet the threshold within the shorter voting duration, then it is converted to a regular proposal and voting restarts under regular voting conditions. Expedited proposals were introduced in Cosmos SDK v0.50, which means they will need to be backported to the [special branch of Cosmos SDK v0.47](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/tree/feature/v0.47.x-ics-lsm) used by the Cosmos Hub.\n\nThere are several use cases for expedited proposals, such as fraud resolutions or participating in Neutron governance, that will be addressed by future signaling proposals. An immediate use case is reducing the voting duration of Software Upgrade proposals and, consequently, speed up the Cosmos Hub upgrade process. We propose to expedite Software Upgrade proposals to one week with the tally threshold set to 66.7% (the default for expedited proposals). Note that all previous proposals starting with the v8 upgrade passed with at least 99% Yes votes.  \n\n## Expedited Proposal Parameters\n\nBackporting the expedited proposal feature from SDK 0.50 would enable any proposal to be submitted as an expedited proposal. There are [three system params that can be set for expedited proposals](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.50.6/proto/cosmos/gov/v1/gov.proto#L242-L254):\n\n- *ExpeditedVotingPeriod* – Duration of the voting period of an expedited proposal. **Our suggestion is to set it to one week.**\n- *ExpeditedThreshold* – Minimum proportion of Yes votes for an expedited proposal to pass. **Our suggestion is to set it to the default value of 0.67.**\n- *ExpeditedMinDeposit* – Minimum deposit for an expedited proposal to enter voting period. **Our suggestion is to set it to 500 ATOMs.**\n\nIn addition to the backport, we will add an ante handler in Gaia to expedite only certain proposals. **Our current proposal is only to allow SoftwareUpgrades to be expedited.**\n\n## Proposal Outcomes\n\nThe following items summarize the voting options and what they mean for this proposal:\n\n**Upon a YES vote:**\n\n- The voting period for Software Upgrade governance proposals will be changed to one week in the next Cosmos Hub upgrade.\n\n**Upon a NO vote:**\n\n- The voting period for Software Upgrade governance proposals will remain unchanged (i.e., two weeks).\n\n**NO WITH VETO** - A ‘NoWithVeto’ vote indicates a proposal either (1) is deemed to be spam, i.e., irrelevant to Cosmos Hub, (2) disproportionately infringes on minority interests, or (3) violates or encourages violation of the rules of engagement as currently set out by Cosmos Hub governance.

Expedited proposals were introduced in Cosmos SDK v0.50, which means they will need to be backported to the [special branch of Cosmos SDK v0.47](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/tree/feature/v0.47.x-ics-lsm) used by the Cosmos Hub.\n\nThere are several use cases for expedited proposals, such as fraud resolutions or participating in Neutron governance, that will be addressed by future signaling proposals. An immediate use case is reducing the voting duration of Software Upgrade proposals and, consequently, speed up the Cosmos Hub upgrade process. We propose to expedite Software Upgrade proposals to one week with the tally threshold set to 66.7% (the default for expedited proposals). Note that all previous proposals starting with the v8 upgrade passed with at least 99% Yes votes.  \n\n## Expedited Proposal Parameters\n\nBackporting the expedited proposal feature from SDK 0.50 would enable any proposal to be submitted as an expedited proposal. There are [three system params that can be set for expedited proposals](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.50.6/proto/cosmos/gov/v1/gov.proto#L242-L254):\n\n- *ExpeditedVotingPeriod* – Duration of the voting period of an expedited proposal. **Our suggestion is to set it to one week.**\n- *ExpeditedThreshold* – Minimum proportion of Yes votes for an expedited proposal to pass. **Our suggestion is to set it to the default value of 0.67.**\n- *ExpeditedMinDeposit* – Minimum deposit for an expedited proposal to enter voting period. **Our suggestion is to set it to 500 ATOMs.**\n\nIn addition to the backport, we will add an ante handler in Gaia to expedite only certain proposals. **Our current proposal is only to allow SoftwareUpgrades to be expedited.**\n\n## Proposal Outcomes\n\nThe following items summarize the voting options and what they mean for this proposal:\n\n**Upon a YES vote:**\n\n- The voting period for Software Upgrade governance proposals will be changed to one week in the next Cosmos Hub upgrade.\n\n**Upon a NO vote:**\n\n- The voting period for Software Upgrade governance proposals will remain unchanged (i.e., two weeks).\n\n**NO WITH VETO** - A ‘NoWithVeto’ vote indicates a proposal either (1) is deemed to be spam, i.e., irrelevant to Cosmos Hub, (2) disproportionately infringes on minority interests, or (3) violates or encourages violation of the rules of engagement as currently set out by Cosmos Hub governance. If the number of ‘NoWithVeto’ votes is greater than a third of total votes, the proposal is rejected and the deposits are burned\n\n**ABSTAIN** - You wish to contribute to quorum but you formally decline to vote either for or against the proposal\n\n## References\n\n- Cosmos SDK docs: https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.50/build/modules/gov#expedited-proposals","proposer":"cosmos1tvqum6psu8waphaatuau2gxpaay4z7zlntmhkv"},{"id":"927","messages":[{"@type":"/cosmos.distribution.v1beta1.MsgCommunityPoolSpend","authority":"cosmos10d07y265gmmuvt4z0w9aw880jnsr700j6zn9kn","recipient":"cosmos1vtqd2nynxwjhhteh945d78mpmfnrfzmmct4sh6","amount":[{"denom":"uatom","amount":"3385000000"}]}],"status":"PROPOSAL_STATUS_PASSED","final_tally_result":{"yes_count":"130314338513872","abstain_count":"9441814239548","no_count":"51228692866","no_with_veto_count":"14495762954"},"submit_time":"2024-06-07T14:41:50.027237841Z","deposit_end_time":"2024-06-21T14:41:50.027237841Z","total_deposit":[{"denom":"uatom","amount":"250000000"}],"voting_start_time":"2024-06-07T14:41:50.027237841Z","voting_end_time":"2024-06-21T14:41:50.027237841Z","metadata":"","title":"Funding 3rd-Party Audit of ATOM Wars / Hydro Platform ","summary":"# Funding 3rd-Party Audit of ATOM Wars / Hydro Platform \r\n\r\nAuthors: [Simply Staking](https://simplystaking.com/)\r\n\r\nTL;DR - SimplyStaking will be commissioning [Oak Security](https://www.oaksecurity.io) to conduct a third-party audit of the Hydro/ATOM Wars code. This will follow a similar format and process as our third-party audit conducted last year on [Replicated Security (Prop 687)](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/proposal-687-passed-replicated-security-3rd-party-audit/8953).  \r\n\r\n## Background\r\nThis proposal aims to use community pool funds to commission a third-party audit for the Hydro/ATOM Wars codebase.\r\n\r\nHydro is a bidding \u0026 governance platform for the efficient deployment of liquidity across the Interchain. Hydro allows projects to bid for deployments of ATOM (and other tokens) liquidity under their control and for the benefit of all ATOM holders.\r\n\r\nFor more information, we advise you to review the recent Forum Post from Thyborg [here](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/atom-wars-introducing-the-hydro-auction-platform/13842). \r\n\r\nAs we saw in our last proposal regarding an audit of key Cosmos Infrastructure (ICS) in Proposal #687, It Is always key to get a second set (or more) of auditors who had no involvement in the designing and building of the code to audit the codebase. This will allow for unbiased vulnerabilities to be disclosed (if any), again, as we saw in Proposal #687. \r\n\r\nSince Hydro will have an element of transferring funds, we need to ensure that the funds will be secure and safe from any attack vectors throughout the whole process.\r\n\r\n## Details of Funding Request\r\nThis audit is to be conducted by Oak Security, one of the most reputable auditors in the space. With the scope of the audit already known to the auditor, they (OAK Security) have presented a quote and timeline for the audit. OAK Security is seeking $23,800 for the audit of the Hydro codebase with an estimated timeline of 1 Week to complete. \r\n\r\nWe believe that the terms and quotes presented by OAK Security are fair and ideal. It is a relatively small request for an audit of this importance.\r\n\r\n## Management\r\nSince this is a community pool spending proposal, we want to ensure the community that the funds will arrive at the designated recipient by creating a multi-sig.\r\n\r\nThe multisig should be comprised of various reputable parties:\r\n\r\n- Damien, Simply Staking\r\n- Jehan, Informal, Inc\r\n- Lexa, Hypha Worker Co-op\r\n\r\n**The multisig address is:** `cosmos1vtqd2nynxwjhhteh945d78mpmfnrfzmmct4sh6`\r\n\r\n## Breakdown of Fees\r\n\r\nWe (Simply Staking) will be the main point of contact with Oak Security which means that we will handle all things related to answering their questions and queries. We will also act as the main coordinator for building and maintaining the multisig to ensure a smooth transfer of funds from the multisig address to the designated recipient (OAK). For the work with Oak Security and the multi-sig coordination, we seek a compensation fee of around 15% of the total ask.\r\n\r\n## Funding\r\n\r\n**OAK Quote**: $23,800 + 10% price buffer to account for the volatility of the ATOM token during the voting period:  $26180\r\n\r\n**Simply Staking Fees**: $3570\r\n- Community consensus via forum and on-chain proposals\r\n- Sourcing vendor quotes\r\n- Coordinating vendor payments and milestones\r\n- Multi-sig coordination\r\n\r\nTotal ask 3385 ATOM @ $8.79 per ATOM ~ $29750\r\n\r\n***All leftover funds will be sent back to the community pool.***\r\n\r\n## Governance votes\r\n\r\nThe following items summarise the voting options and what it means for this proposal:\r\n\r\n**YES** - You agree that this external audit should be funded.\r\n\r\n**NO** - You disagree that this external audit should be funded. \r\n\r\n**NO WITH VETO** - A ‘NoWithVeto’ vote indicates a proposal either (1) is deemed to be spam, i.e., irrelevant to Cosmos Hub, (2) disproportionately infringes on minority interests, or (3) violates or encourages violation of the rules of engagement as currently set out by Cosmos Hub governance.

You can view the ADR [here](https://cosmos.github.io/interchain-security/adrs/adr-017-allowing-inactive-validators). \n\nStarting with the introduction of ICS 2.0 (aka Partial Set Security) in the [v17 upgrade](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/924), only validators from the Cosmos Hub’s active validator set can opt-in to validate on consumer chains. This signaling proposal enables validators from outside the Cosmos Hub’s active validator set to validate on consumer chains.\n\nThis signaling proposal will not immediately enable the feature, but instead signal the community’s interest in having it. If the proposal passes, the feature will be included in a software update in the next few months.\n\n## Benefits\nThis feature brings benefits to both consumer chains (or projects wanting to launch as a consumer chain in the Cosmos Hub) and Hub validators. First, it reduces the entry barrier for new projects with lower security budgets, especially given their potential lower security needs. Second, it enables validators from outside the Hub’s active set to compete by opting in to validate on promising new projects.\n\nIn addition, the feature addresses an existing concern of ICS 2.0 — what happens if all the validators running a consumer chain are opting out. One solution is for the team behind the consumer chain to run their own validator node. However, at the time of writing, the last validator in the Hub’s active set has around 91k ATOMs bonded. By extending the pool of available validators, the amount of bonded ATOMs needed to validate on a consumer chain would be lowered.\n\n## Risks and Mitigations\nThe main risk behind this proposal is that it might let validators with little stake and reputation validate consumer chains. This also brings an additional risk of sybil attacks (i.e. a single entity controlling many validator nodes), which could make the validator set of consumer chains appear decentralized, when it is in reality controlled by a single entity.\n\nWe plan to mitigate this risk by going in small steps and, for the first iteration, only allowing the first 20 validators outside the Cosmos Hub’s active validator set to validate on consumer chains. We expect that this will still be a relatively competitive set.\n\nAdditionally, we plan to introduce a per-consumer-chain parameter which sets the minimum amount of stake a validator must have to be eligible to validate on the consumer. This parameter is set by each consumer chain individually according to their preferences. If a consumer leaves the parameter unset, the Hub will set it to the amount of stake bonded by the bottom validator in its active set; in other words, if the parameter is unset, only validators from the Hub’s active set are allowed to validate the consumer.\n\n## How the feature will work\nCurrently, the validator set flows to consumer chains (via the provider module) and the consensus engine (CometBFT) separately, and in both cases is taken from the staking module, see this figure:\n\n![image](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafybeia2fqjvhzi4v45nfckgx37llakneehqryv3psehpmihvic4mpz3pe/)\n\nFor this feature, we will increase the size of the active set on the Cosmos Hub to include more validators. However, to ensure that these extra validators are not impacting the network operations, we route the validator set through the provider module, filtering the set of validators to a smaller set (which will be exactly what the active set is today). This means rewards, slashing for infractions on the Cosmos Hub, etc stay as they are today: They take into account only the first 180 validators (the size of the active set at the time of writing). The new flow of the validator set to CometBFT and consumer chains looks like this:\n\n![image](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmXRTLGzHi9hD9wFTgL8A7aaHVuHcCtti2VWfPWRiKov5V)\n\nFor all modules, we will set them up to either utilize the full set of validators from the staking module, or the filtered set of validators from the provider module, as appropriate.\n\nFor more details, checkout out the [ADR](https://cosmos.github.io/interchain-security/adrs/adr-017-allowing-inactive-validators).\n\n## Proposal Outcomes\nThe following items summarize the voting options and what they mean for this proposal:\n\n**Upon a YES vote:** \n- Starting when the feature is included in an upcoming Cosmos Hub upgrade, the first 20 validators outside the Cosmos Hub’s active validator set will be able to opt-in to validate on consumer chains.\n\n**Upon a NO vote:** \n- Only validators from the Hub’s active validator set will be able to opt-in to validate on consumer chains.\n\n**NO WITH VETO** - A ‘NoWithVeto’ vote indicates a proposal either (1) is deemed to be spam, i.e., irrelevant to Cosmos Hub, (2) disproportionately infringes on minority interests, or (3) violates or encourages violation of the rules of engagement as currently set out by Cosmos Hub governance.

To ensure validators are able to smoothly onboard Slinky, the module will initially be introduced without jailing for failing to submit data as part of the vote extension process.\n\nThis proposal seeks 360,000 NTRN from the Cosmos Hub community pool to be distributed as performance incentives to Cosmos Hub validators based on their Slinky uptime during the Slinky Beta.\n\n## Background on Slinky\n\nDesigned for DeFi, [Slinky](https://docs.skip.money/slinky/overview/) brings oracles on-chain to minimize dependencies and offer faster, more secure price feeds. It relies on a specific Cosmos SDK module and ABCI++ to publish off-chain data such as prices on-chain at every block.\n\nSlinky comes with a highly optimized and reliable piece of software called the Sidecar, which validators run in tandem with chain binaries to fetch prices safely and reliably from over 20+ providers; running aggregation logic to combine them into a single price for each feed.\n\nSkip provides full operational support for Neutron and Cosmos Hub validators with 1-day SLAs for adding new feeds, and 24/7 on-call support and maintenance by the Skip team.\n\n## Security Model\n\nWith Slinky, data is only submitted if 2/3rds of the voting power agrees on its validity. As a result, the oracle is trust-minimized (just like IBC) since it does not introduce additional trust assumptions beyond the honesty of the network’s validator set. This ensures that the published data is as reliable as the network itself.\n\nIf less than 2/3rd of the voting power comes to consensus, the data is not published. If this happens multiple blocks in a row, the available data, for example a price feed, could become increasingly stale, which can pose a threat to the applications (restaking, DeFi, etc) that rely on it.\n\nTo prevent this issue, Slinky will implement downtime jailing. Just like traditional CometBFT behavior: validators that consistently fail to vote on prices will stop receiving block rewards until they resume participation. As long as validators follow the correct operation guides and act honestly, jailing should never happen.\n\nAs described below, jailing will NOT be enabled in the initial release, which is considered a Beta.\n\n## Slinky Beta\n\nTo ensure a smooth onboarding experience for Cosmos Hub validators, Slinky will launch under Beta and with oracle-price-update jailing disabled. The Beta phase will start upon Slinky’s launch on Neutron’s mainnet and last 3 months or until Cosmos Hub validators have achieved a high degree of stability and performance, whichever occurs first.\n\nDuring this period, core contributors from Skip Protocol and Hadron Labs will assist validators with properly setting up and operating the sidecar. Skip Protocol has developed dedicated documentation about the deployment which can be found [here](https://docs.skip.money/slinky/integrations/neutron).\n\n## Performance incentives\n\nTo encourage excellence among the set, we propose to make validators eligible to rewards up to 2000 NTRN based on the percentage of Beta-period blocks in which they successfully published updated data. This has been modified according to validator feedback as follows: \n\n* Less than 90% - No reward\n* 90-95% - 500 NTRN\n* 95-99% - 1000 NTRN\n* More than 99% - 2000 NTRN\n\nNTRN rewards would be provided by the Cosmos Hub Community Pool in line with the ‘Cooperation’ clause agreed in respect of the Hubs NTRN holdings in [proposal 835](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/835/). These performance rewards would come as a bonus on top of the existing validator subsidy approved in [Cosmos Hub proposal 867](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/867/).\n\n## Implementation\n\nThis proposal includes an executable transfer message for 360,000 NTRN from the Cosmos Hub Community pool to a 2/3 multisig composed of members from Informal Systems, Hypha and CryptoCrew Validator.\n\n**Multisig**\n\ncosmos1h5pmn0uza3hphdfy9adew64cfgnvt00dnrmrg6\n\n**Signers**\n\nChristian - CryptoCrew - cosmos1y6vfcekl4wycqfmfkwlchpr876wehd7yz74lvn\n\nBrian - Informal - cosmos1vy22e0s5e9pj3w2ur2f4sgp3gd3qdqldhk533a\n\nDante - Hypha - cosmos12lprpucjwul7kqyvlvc0u4x9atymmex0s6d2zc\n\nAny excess NTRN not paid out to validators as rewards for their price update performance during the Beta period will be returned to the Hub Community Pool by the multisig at the end of the beta period.\n\n## Important note to application developers\n\nDuring the Slinky Beta, the oracle may experience major price deviations, price update delays, or other sudden issues. It will only be intended to be used for experimentation and training purposes by developers and validators. We advise against using Slinky to secure meaningful amounts of funds or to power production deployments of protocols during the beta phase.\n\n## Timeline\n\n* Early June (exp. June 12th): Slinky launches on Pion-1 Testnet as part of Neutron V4 upgrade\n* Mid June (exp. June 19th): Proposal to upgrade Neutron mainnet to V4\n* Early July (exp. July 3rd): Neutron V4 Mainnet Upgrade\n* Q3-Q4 (End of beta phase): Price update downtime jailing is enabled. Performance rewards are paid out. Excess NTRN is returned to the Cosmos Hub community pool.\n\n## Governance votes\n\nThe following items summarize the voting options and what they mean for this proposal:\n\nYES: You wish to signal your approval for the distribution of NTRN performance incentives from the Cosmos Hub community pool to Cosmos Hub validators based on the % of blocks in which they successfully publish updated prices during the Slinky Beta.\n\nNO: You oppose the distribution of NTRN performance incentives from the Cosmos Hub community pool to the Cosmos Hub validators for their participation in publishing price updates on Slinky.\n\nABSTAIN: You wish to contribute to the quorum but you formally decline to vote either for or against the proposal.\n\nNO WITH VETO: A ‘NoWithVeto’ vote indicates a proposal either (1) is deemed to be spam, i.e., irrelevant to Cosmos Hub, (2) disproportionately infringes on minority interests, or (3) violates or encourages violation of the rules of engagement as currently set out by Cosmos Hub governance.

This is a proposal for the Hub to create an ICA on Neutron that is controlled by the Hub's governance. While there are many reasons why the Hub might want this ICA on Neutron, one reason to create the ICA now is to enable the Hub to migrate its three current liquidity sharing deals off of the multisig controlled by AADAO and onto a trustless solution. To be clear, this proposal does not commit the Hub to performing any specific actions with the ICA. Rather the goal is to establish a general purpose ICA to Neutron for a wide variety of future use cases.\r\n\r\n## Reducing reliance on multisigs for remote actions\r\nComposability in an app chain world requires the ability to perform remote actions. Today, all remote behavior must be performed via multi-sigs with nominated committees, which have numerous issues:\r\n\r\n### Administrative overhead\r\nRecruiting the people necessary to manage the multisig takes time, as does coordinating each signing event among many parties. Due to the high security nature of multisig operations and lack of tooling, using a multisig requires a high degree of technical sophistication (e.g., interacting with node binaries via CLI, Ledger compatibility, etc.). This means a very limited number of people are currently eligible to participate, most of whom are extremely busy. These factors compound to make the coordination of signing events immensely painful. Moreover, to rotate members off of a cryptographic multisig actually requires instantiating an entirely new account and moving all funds. This makes member rotation for cryptographic multisigs incompatible with certain types of remote actions. DAODAO is a significant improvement on a number of dimensions, but is not yet available.\r\n\r\n### Liability\r\nThe liability surface of being a multisig signer makes it impossible for some to participate, and exposes those who do participate to unknown legal risk.\r\n\r\n### Trust Vulnerabilities\r\nEven after finding willing and able multisig members, those dependent on the multisig are counting on the multisig members continuing to act in good faith. An extraordinary amount of effort is dedicated toward making protocols trustless – having a multisig act perform a core protocol function is contradictory to the ethos of crypto.\r\n\r\n### Operational Risk\r\nEven if the individuals on the multisig continue acting in good faith, members of the multisig could lose their passphrase, have their accounts compromised by a malicious actor, or execute an incorrect message.\r\n\r\n### Slow Response\r\nEven if the people on the multisig have nothing better to do than manage the multisig, the manual work required means that the funds managed by the multisig members cannot respond in real time to on-chain events. This precludes the introduction of automated mechanisms and the range of remote actions the Hub could take.\r\n\r\n## Interchain account as an alternative to multisigs\r\nEstablishing an ICA on Neutron that is controlled directly by Hub governance would enable the Hub to engage in a wide range of remote actions without the need for an intermediary multisig.\r\n\r\nWe at Timewave are excited to use the ICA to eliminate the need for the Hubs existing multisigs and use the ICA in conjunction with our Covenant System to expand the number of actions that the Hub can take in a trustless manner using this ICA. That said, the creation of this ICA ***DOES NOT*** commit the Hub to any specific remote actions. Establishing this ICA now simply removed the need for the Hub to have to deal with this technical step in the future when seeking to take a remote action.\r\n## Conclusion\r\nLets make it happen.\r\n\r\n## Who we are: Timewave\r\nTimewave is a team dedicated to increasing the scope and scale of interoperability between crypto-native organizations. If you have ideas for how we can further this mission, we would love to hear from you: @TimewaveLabs.\r\n\r\n## Governance votes\r\nThe following items summarize the voting options and what they mean for this proposal:\r\n\r\nYes - You wish for the creation of a Hub-controlled ICA on Neutron\r\nNo - You do not approve of a Hub-controlled ICA to be created on Neutron\r\nAbstain - You wish to contribute to the quorum but you formally decline to vote either for or against the proposal.\r\nNoWithVeto - A NoWithVeto vote indicates a proposal either (1) is deemed to be spam, i.e., irrelevant to Cosmos Hub, (2) disproportionately infringes on minority interests, or (3) violates or encourages violation of the rules of engagement as currently set out by Cosmos Hub governance.

After collecting forum feedback (~ 1 week) and adapting the proposal as required, a governance proposal will be sent to the Cosmos Hub for voting. The on-chain voting period typically lasts 2 weeks.\nOn governance vote approval, validators will be required to update the Cosmos Hub binary at the halt-height specified in the on-chain proposal.\n### Release Binary \u0026 Upgrade Resources\nIMPORTANT: Note that Gaia v18.0.0 binary MUST be used.\n- The release can be found [here](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/releases/tag/v18.0.0).\n- The changelog can be found [here](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/blob/v18.0.0/CHANGELOG.md).\n- The upgrade guide can be found [here](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/blob/release/v18.x/UPGRADING.md).\nUPGRADE NOTES:\n- You must use Golang v1.22 if building from source.\n- Building the `gaiad` binary on Windows is not supported due to [dependency issues](https://github.com/CosmWasm/wasmvm). Please check the [updated docs](https://hub.cosmos.network/main/getting-started/installation#install-go) for more info.\n### Release Contents\nThis release adds the following features:\n- Permissioned CosmWasm (as per [prop 895](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/895)) enables the governance-gated deployment of CosmWasm contracts. See [this forum discussion](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/discussion-hub-cosmwasm-guidelines/13788) for more details on what contracts should be deployed on the Hub.\n- Skip's [feemarket module](https://github.com/skip-mev/feemarket) (as per [prop 842](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/842)) enables the dynamic adjustment of the base transaction fee based on the block utilization (the more transactions in a block, the higher the base fee). This module replaces the [x/globalfee module](https://hub.cosmos.network/v17.1.0/architecture/adr/adr-002-globalfee).\n- [Expedited proposals](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.50/build/modules/gov#expedited-proposals) (as per [prop 926](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/926)) enable governance proposals with a shorter voting period (i.e., one week instead of two), but with a higher tally threshold (i.e., 66.7% of Yes votes for the proposal to pass) and a higher minimum deposit (i.e., 500 ATOMs instead of the 250 for regular proposals). Initially, only `MsgSoftwareUpgrade` and `MsgCancelUpgrade` can be expedited.\nThe release also bumps the following dependencies:\n- Golang to v1.22\n- Cosmos SDK to [v0.47.16-ics-lsm](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/tree/v0.47.16-ics-lsm)\n- IBC to [v7.6.0](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/releases/tag/v7.6.0)\n- ICS to [v4.3.0-lsm](https://github.com/cosmos/interchain-security/releases/tag/v4.3.0-lsm)\n### Testing and Testnets\nThe v18 release has gone through rigorous testing, including e2e tests, integration tests, and differential tests. Differential tests are similar to integration tests, but they compare the system state to an expected state generated from a model implementation. In addition, v18 has been independently tested by the team at Hypha Co-op.\nValidators and node operators have joined a public testnet to participate in a test upgrade to a release candidate before the Cosmos Hub upgrades to the final release. You can find the relevant information (genesis file, peers, etc.) to join the [Release testnet](https://github.com/cosmos/testnets/tree/master/public)  (theta-testnet-001), or the [Interchain Security testnet](https://github.com/cosmos/testnets/tree/master/interchain-security) (provider).\n### Potential risk factors\nAlthough very extensive testing and simulation will have taken place there always exists a risk that the Cosmos Hub might experience problems due to potential bugs or errors from the new features. In the case of serious problems, validators should stop operating the network immediately.\nCoordination with validators will happen in the [#cosmos-hub-validators-verified](https://discord.com/channels/669268347736686612/798937713474142229) channel of the Cosmos Network Discord to create and execute a contingency plan. Likely this will be an emergency release with fixes or the recommendation to consider the upgrade aborted and revert back to the previous release of gaia (v17).\n### Governance votes\nThe following items summarize the voting options and what it means for this proposal:\n**YES** - You agree that the Cosmos Hub should be updated with this release.\n**NO** - You disagree that the Cosmos Hub should be updated with this release.\n**NO WITH VETO** - A ‘NoWithVeto’ vote indicates a proposal either (1) is deemed to be spam, i.e., irrelevant to Cosmos Hub, (2) disproportionately infringes on minority interests, or (3) violates or encourages violation of the rules of engagement as currently set out by Cosmos Hub governance. If the number of ‘NoWithVeto’ votes is greater than a third of total votes, the proposal is rejected and the deposits are burned.\n**ABSTAIN** - You wish to contribute to the quorum but you formally decline to vote either for or against the proposal.","proposer":"cosmos13c3gup8sufc47xhqau3h2hyez2v4y4q5lwmr48"}],"pagination":{"next_key":null,"total":"218"}}
